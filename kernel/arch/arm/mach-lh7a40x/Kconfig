config LH7A40X_CONTIGMEM
	bool "Disable NUMA/SparseMEM Support"
	help
	  Say Y here if your bootloader sets the SROMLL bit(s) in
	  the SDRAM controller, organizing memory as a contiguous
	  array.  This option will disable sparse memory support
          and force the kernel to manage all memory in one node.

	  Setting this option incorrectly may prevent the kernel
	  from booting.  It is OK to leave it N.

	  For more information, consult
	    <file:Documentation/arm/Sharp-LH/SDRAM>.

config LH7A40X_ONE_BANK_PER_NODE
	bool "Optimize NUMA Node Tables for Size"
	depends on !LH7A40X_CONTIGMEM
	help
	  Say Y here to produce compact memory node tables.  By
	  default pairs of adjacent physical RAM banks are managed
	  together in a single node, incurring some wasted overhead
	  in the node tables, however also maintaining compatibility
	  with systems where physical memory is truly contiguous.

	  Setting this option incorrectly may prevent the kernel from
	  booting.  It is OK to leave it N.

	  For more information, consult
	    <file:Documentation/arm/Sharp-LH/SDRAM>.
