   DESCRIPTION
   -----------

   This SSP header is available throughout the kernel, for this
   machine/architecture, because drivers that use it may be dispersed.

   This file was cloned from the 7952x implementation.  It would be
   better to share them, but we're taking an easier approach for the
   time being.
