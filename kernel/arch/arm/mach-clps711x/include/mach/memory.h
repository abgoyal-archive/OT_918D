/*
 * Like the SA1100, the EDB7211 has a large gap between physical RAM
 * banks.  In 2.2, the Psion (CL-PS7110) port added custom support for
 * discontiguous physical memory.  In 2.4, we can use the standard
 * Linux NUMA support.
 *
 * This is not necessary for EP7211 implementations with only one used
 * memory bank.  For those systems, simply undefine CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM.
 */

/*
 * The PS7211 allows up to 256MB max per DRAM bank, but the EDB7211
 * uses only one of the two banks (bank #1).  However, even within
 * bank #1, memory is discontiguous.
 *
 * The EDB7211 has two 8MB DRAM areas with 8MB of empty space between
 * them, so we use 24 for the node max shift to get 16MB node sizes.
 */

/*
 * Because of the wide memory address space between physical RAM banks on the 
 * SA1100, it's much more convenient to use Linux's NUMA support to implement
 * our memory map representation.  Assuming all memory nodes have equal access 
 * characteristics, we then have generic discontiguous memory support.
 *
 * Of course, all this isn't mandatory for SA1100 implementations with only
 * one used memory bank.  For those, simply undefine CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM.
 *
 * The nodes are matched with the physical memory bank addresses which are 
 * incidentally the same as virtual addresses.
 * 
 * 	node 0:  0xc0000000 - 0xc7ffffff
 * 	node 1:  0xc8000000 - 0xcfffffff
 * 	node 2:  0xd0000000 - 0xd7ffffff
 * 	node 3:  0xd8000000 - 0xdfffffff
