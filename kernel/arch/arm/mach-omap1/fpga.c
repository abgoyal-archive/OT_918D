/*
 * All of the FPGA interrupt request inputs except for the touchscreen are
 * edge-sensitive; the touchscreen is level-sensitive.  The edge-sensitive
 * interrupts are acknowledged as a side-effect of reading the interrupt
 * status register from the FPGA.  The edge-sensitive interrupt inputs
 * cause a problem with level interrupt requests, such as Ethernet.  The
 * problem occurs when a level interrupt request is asserted while its
 * interrupt input is masked in the FPGA, which results in a missed
 * interrupt.
 *
 * In an attempt to workaround the problem with missed interrupts, the
 * mask_ack routine for all of the FPGA interrupts has been changed from
 * fpga_mask_ack_irq() to fpga_ack_irq() so that the specific FPGA interrupt
 * being serviced is left unmasked.  We can do this because the FPGA cascade
 * interrupt is installed with the IRQF_DISABLED flag, which leaves all
 * interrupts masked at the CPU while an FPGA interrupt handler executes.
 *
 * Limited testing indicates that this workaround appears to be effective
 * for the smc9194 Ethernet driver used on the Innovator.  It should work
 * on other FPGA interrupts as well, but any drivers that explicitly mask
 * interrupts at the interrupt controller via disable_irq/enable_irq
 * could pose a problem.
