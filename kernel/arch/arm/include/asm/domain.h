 * Domain numbers
 *
 *  DOMAIN_IO     - domain 2 includes all IO only
 *  DOMAIN_USER   - domain 1 includes all user memory only
 *  DOMAIN_KERNEL - domain 0 includes all kernel memory only
 *
 * The domain numbering depends on whether we support 36 physical
 * address for I/O or not.  Addresses above the 32 bit boundary can
 * only be mapped using supersections and supersections can only
 * be set for domain 0.  We could just default to DOMAIN_IO as zero,
 * but there may be systems with supersection support and no 36-bit
 * addressing.  In such cases, we want to map system memory with
 * supersections to reduce TLB misses and footprint.
 *
 * 36-bit addressing and supersections are only available on
 * CPUs based on ARMv6+ or the Intel XSC3 core.
