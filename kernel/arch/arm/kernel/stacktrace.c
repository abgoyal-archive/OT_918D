 * Unwind the current stack frame and store the new register values in the

 * hence the new PC value rather than LR should be used for backtrace.
 *
 * With framepointer enabled, a simple function prologue looks like this:
 *	mov	ip, sp
 *	stmdb	sp!, {fp, ip, lr, pc}
 *	sub	fp, ip, #4
 *
 * A simple function epilogue looks like this:
 *	ldm	sp, {fp, sp, pc}
 *
 * Note that with framepointer enabled, even the leaf functions have the same
 * prologue and epilogue, therefore we can ignore the LR value in this case.
