	  RealView boards other than PB1176 have the RAM available at
	  0x70000000, 256MB of which being mirrored at 0x00000000. If
	  the board supports 512MB of RAM, this option allows the
	  memory to be accessed contiguously at the high physical
	  offset. On the PBX board, disabling this option allows 1GB of
	  RAM to be used with SPARSEMEM.
