The `LIT64' macro takes as its argument a textual integer literal and if
necessary ``marks'' the literal as having a 64-bit integer type.  For
example, the Gnu C Compiler (`gcc') requires that 64-bit literals be
appended with the letters `LL' standing for `long long', which is `gcc's
name for the 64-bit integer type.  Some compilers may allow `LIT64' to be
defined as the identity macro:  `#define LIT64( a ) a'.
