This C header file is part of the SoftFloat IEC/IEEE Floating-point
Arithmetic Package, Release 2.

Written by John R. Hauser.  This work was made possible in part by the
International Computer Science Institute, located at Suite 600, 1947 Center
Street, Berkeley, California 94704.  Funding was partially provided by the
National Science Foundation under grant MIP-9311980.  The original version
of this code was written as part of a project to build a fixed-point vector
processor in collaboration with the University of California at Berkeley,
overseen by Profs. Nelson Morgan and John Wawrzynek.  More information
is available through the Web page `http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU/~jhauser/
