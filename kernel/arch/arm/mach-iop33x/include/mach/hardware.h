 * Note about PCI IO space mappings

 * To make IO space accesses efficient, we store virtual addresses in

 *
 * The PCI IO space is located at virtual 0xfe000000 from physical
 * 0x90000000.  The PCI BARs must be programmed with physical addresses,
 * but when we read them, we convert them to virtual addresses.  See
