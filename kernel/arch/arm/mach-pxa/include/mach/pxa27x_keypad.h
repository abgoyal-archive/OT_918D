 * NOTE:
 * 1. direct_key_num indicates the number of keys in the direct keypad
 *    _plus_ the number of rotary-encoder sensor inputs,  this can be
 *    left as 0 if only rotary encoders are enabled,  the driver will
 *    automatically calculate this
 *
 * 2. direct_key_map is the key code map for the direct keys, if rotary
 *    encoder(s) are enabled, direct key 0/1(2/3) will be ignored
 *
 * 3. rotary can be either interpreted as a relative input event (e.g.
 *    REL_WHEEL/REL_HWHEEL) or specific keys (e.g. UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT)
 *
 * 4. matrix key and direct key will use the same debounce_interval by
 *    default, which should be sufficient in most cases
