 * The A? revisions of the IXP2000s assert byte lanes for PCI I/O
 * transactions the other way round (MEM transactions don't have this
 * issue), so if we want to support those models, we need to override
 * the standard I/O functions.
 *
 * B0 and later have a bit that can be set to 1 to get the proper
 * behavior for I/O transactions, which then allows us to use the
 * standard I/O functions.  This is what we do if the user does not
 * explicitly ask for support for pre-B0.
