 * A small note about bridges and interrupts.  The DECchip 21050 (and
 * later) adheres to the PCI-PCI bridge specification.  This says that
 * the interrupts on the other side of a bridge are swizzled in the
 * following manner:
 *
 * Dev    Interrupt   Interrupt 
 *        Pin on      Pin on 
 *        Device      Connector
 *
 *   4    A           A
 *        B           B
 *        C           C
 *        D           D
 * 
 *   5    A           B

 *
 * Where A = pin 1, B = pin 2 and so on and pin=0 = default = A.
