/*
 * switch_to() saves the extra registers, that are not saved
 * automatically by SAVE_SWITCH_STACK in resume(), ie. d0-d5 and
 * a0-a1. Some of these are used by schedule() and its predecessors
 * and so we might get see unexpected behaviors when a task returns
 * with unexpected register values.
 *
 * syscall stores these registers itself and none of them are used
 * by syscall after the function in the syscall has been called.
 *
 * Beware that resume now expects *next to be in d1 and the offset of
 * tss to be in a1. This saves a few instructions as we no longer have
 * to push them onto the stack and read them back right after.

 * pass prev in a0, next in a1, offset of tss in d1, and whether
 * the mm structures are shared in d2 (to avoid atc flushing).
