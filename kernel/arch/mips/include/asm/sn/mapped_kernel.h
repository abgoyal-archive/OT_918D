/*
 * Note on how mapped kernels work: the text and data section is
 * compiled at cksseg segment (LOADADDR = 0xc001c000), and the
 * init/setup/data section gets a 16M virtual address bump in the
 * ld.script file (so that tlblo0 and tlblo1 maps the sections).
 * The vmlinux.64 section addresses are put in the xkseg range
 * using the change-addresses makefile option. Use elfdump -of
 * on IRIX to see where the sections go. The Origin loader loads
 * the two sections contiguously in physical memory. The loader
 * sets the entry point into kernel_entry using a xkphys address,
 * but instead of using 0xa800000001160000, it uses the address
 * 0xa800000000160000, which is where it physically loaded that
 * code. So no jumps can be done before we have switched to using
 * cksseg addresses.
