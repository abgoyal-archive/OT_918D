/*
 * The launch data structure resides at a fixed place in each node's memory
 * and is used to communicate between the master processor and the slave
 * processors.
 *
 * The master stores launch parameters in the launch structure
 * corresponding to a target processor that is in a slave loop, then sends
 * an interrupt to the slave processor.  The slave calls the desired
 * function, followed by an optional rendezvous function, then returns to
 * the slave loop.  The master does not wait for the slaves before
 * returning.
 *
 * There is an array of launch structures, one per CPU on the node.  One
 * interrupt level is used per CPU.
