 * These five resource limit IDs have a MIPS/Linux-specific ordering,
 * the rest comes from the generic header:
 */
#define RLIMIT_NOFILE		5	/* max number of open files */
#define RLIMIT_AS		6	/* address space limit */
#define RLIMIT_RSS		7	/* max resident set size */
#define RLIMIT_NPROC		8	/* max number of processes */
#define RLIMIT_MEMLOCK		9	/* max locked-in-memory address space */

/*
 * SuS says limits have to be unsigned.
 * Which makes a ton more sense anyway,
 * but we keep the old value on MIPS32,
 * for compatibility:
