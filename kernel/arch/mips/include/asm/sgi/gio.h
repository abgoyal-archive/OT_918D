/*
 * GIO bus addresses
 *
 * The Indigo and Indy have two GIO bus connectors. Indigo2 (all models) have
 * three physical connectors, but only two slots, GFX and EXP0.
 *
 * There is 10MB of GIO address space for GIO64 slot devices
 * slot#   slot type address range            size
 * -----   --------- ----------------------- -----
 *   0     GFX       0x1f000000 - 0x1f3fffff   4MB
 *   1     EXP0      0x1f400000 - 0x1f5fffff   2MB
 *   2     EXP1      0x1f600000 - 0x1f9fffff   4MB
 *
 * There are un-slotted devices, HPC, I/O and misc devices, which are grouped
 * into the HPC address space.
 *   -     MISC      0x1fb00000 - 0x1fbfffff   1MB
 *
 * Following space is reserved and unused
 *   -     RESERVED  0x18000000 - 0x1effffff 112MB
 *
 * GIO bus IDs
 *
 * Each GIO bus device identifies itself to the system by answering a
 * read with an "ID" value. IDs are either 8 or 32 bits long. IDs less
 * than 128 are 8 bits long, with the most significant 24 bits read from
 * the slot undefined.
 *
 * 32-bit IDs are divided into
 *	bits 0:6        the product ID; ranges from 0x00 to 0x7F.
 *	bit 7		0=GIO Product ID is 8 bits wide
 *			1=GIO Product ID is 32 bits wide.
 *	bits 8:15       manufacturer version for the product.
 *	bit 16		0=GIO32 and GIO32-bis, 1=GIO64.
 *	bit 17		0=no ROM present
 *			1=ROM present on this board AND next three words
 *			space define the ROM.
 *	bits 18:31	up to manufacturer.
 *
 * IDs above 0x50/0xd0 are of 3rd party boards.
 *
 * 8-bit IDs
 *	0x01		XPI low cost FDDI
 *	0x02		GTR TokenRing
 *	0x04		Synchronous ISDN
 *	0x05		ATM board [*]

 *	0x0d		Babblefish Compression [*]
 *	0x0e		E-Plex 8-port Ethernet
 *	0x30		Lyon Lamb IVAS
 *	0xb8		GIO 100BaseTX Fast Ethernet (gfe)
