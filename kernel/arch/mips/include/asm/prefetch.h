/*
 * R5000 and RM5200 implements pref and prefx instructions but they're nops, so
 * rather than wasting time we pretend these processors don't support
 * prefetching at all.
 *
 * R5432 implements Load, Store, LoadStreamed, StoreStreamed, LoadRetained,
 * StoreRetained and WriteBackInvalidate but not Pref_PrepareForStore.
 *
 * Hell (and the book on my shelf I can't open ...) know what the R8000 does.
 *
 * RM7000 version 1.0 interprets all hints as Pref_Load; version 2.0 implements
 * Pref_PrepareForStore also.
 *
 * RM9000 is MIPS IV but implements prefetching like MIPS32/MIPS64; it's
 * Pref_WriteBackInvalidate is a nop and Pref_PrepareForStore is broken in
 * current versions due to erratum G105.
 *
 * VR5500 (including VR5701 and VR7701) only implement load prefetch.
 *
 * Finally MIPS32 and MIPS64 implement all of the following hints.
