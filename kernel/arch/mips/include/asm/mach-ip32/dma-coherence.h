 * Few notes.
 * 1. CPU sees memory as two chunks: 0-256M@0x0, and the rest @0x40000000+256M
 * 2. PCI sees memory as one big chunk @0x0 (or we could use 0x40000000 for
 *    native-endian)
 * 3. All other devices see memory as one big chunk at 0x40000000
 * 4. Non-PCI devices will pass NULL as struct device*
 *
 * Thus we translate differently, depending on device.
