 * FUNC is executed in one of the uncached segments, depending on its
 * original address as follows:
 *
 * 1. If the original address is in CKSEG0 or CKSEG1, then the uncached
 *    segment used is CKSEG1.
 * 2. If the original address is in XKPHYS, then the uncached segment
 *    used is XKPHYS(2).
 * 3. Otherwise it's a bug.
 *
 * The same remapping is done with the stack pointer.  Stack handling
 * works because we don't handle stack arguments or more complex return
 * values, so we can avoid sharing the same stack area between a cached
 * and the uncached mode.
