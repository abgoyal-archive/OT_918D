	help
	  The nodes of Origin, Onyx, Fuel and Tezro systems can be configured
	  in either N-Modes which allows for more nodes or M-Mode which allows
	  for more memory.  Your hardware is almost certainly running in
	  M-Mode, so choose M-mode here.

config MAPPED_KERNEL
	bool "Mapped kernel support"
	depends on SGI_IP27
	help
	  Change the way a Linux kernel is loaded into memory on a MIPS64
	  machine.  This is required in order to support text replication on
	  NUMA.  If you need to understand it, read the source code.

	bool "Kernel text replication support"
	depends on SGI_IP27
	select MAPPED_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here to enable replicating the kernel text across multiple
	  nodes in a NUMA cluster.  This trades memory for speed.

	depends on SGI_IP27
	help
	  Say Y here to enable replicating the kernel exception handlers
	  across multiple nodes in a NUMA cluster. This trades memory for
	  speed.
