/*
 * The way that the Blackfin core timer works is:
 *  - CCLK is divided by a programmable 8-bit pre-scaler (TSCALE)
 *  - Every time TSCALE ticks, a 32bit is counted down (TCOUNT)
 *
 * If you take the fastest clock (1ns, or 1GHz to make the math work easier)
 *    10ms is 10,000,000 clock ticks, which fits easy into a 32-bit counter
 *    (32 bit counter is 4,294,967,296ns or 4.2 seconds) so, we don't need
 *    to use TSCALE, and program it to zero (which is pass CCLK through).
 *    If you feel like using it, try to keep HZ * TIMESCALE to some
 *    value that divides easy (like power of 2).
