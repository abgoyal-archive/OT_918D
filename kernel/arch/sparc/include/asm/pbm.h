 *
 * To put things into perspective, consider sparc64 with a few PCI controllers.
 * Each type would have an own structure, with instances related one to one.
 * We have only pcic on sparc, but we want to be compatible with sparc64 pbm.h.
 * All three represent different abstractions.

 *   pbm      - Arch-specific view of a PCI bus (sparc or sparc64)
 *   pcic     - Chip-specific information for PCIC.
