/* To avoid some locking problems, we hard allocate certain PILs
 * for SMP cross call messages that must do a etrap/rtrap.
 *
 * A local_irq_disable() does not block the cross call delivery, so
 * when SMP locking is an issue we reschedule the event into a PIL
 * interrupt which is blocked by local_irq_disable().
 *
 * In fact any XCALL which has to etrap/rtrap has a problem because
 * it is difficult to prevent rtrap from running BH's, and that would
 * need to be done if the XCALL arrived while %pil==PIL_NORMAL_MAX.
 *
 * Finally, in order to handle profiling events even when a
 * local_irq_disable() is in progress, we only disable up to level 14
 * interrupts.  Profile counter overflow interrupts arrive at level
 * 15.
