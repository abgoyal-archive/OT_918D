 * MBZ: These bits are either unused and/or reserved and should

 *
 * CONTEXT: Records the context to which this cache line belongs.
 *
 * WRITE: A copy of the writable bit from the mmu pte access bits.
 *
 * PRIV: A copy of the privileged bit from the pte access bits.
 *
 * VALID: If set, this line is valid, else invalid.
 *
 * TagID: Fourteen bits of tag ID.
 *
 * Every virtual address is seen by the cache like this:
 *
 * ----------------------------------------
 * |  RESV  | TagID | LINE | BYTE-in-LINE |
 * ----------------------------------------
 *  31    30 29   16 15   4 3            0

 * RESV: Unused/reserved.
 *
 * TagID: Used to match the Tag-ID in that vac tags.
 *
 * LINE: Which line within the cache
 *
 * BYTE-in-LINE: Which byte within the cache line.
