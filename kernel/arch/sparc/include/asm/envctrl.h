/* Application note:
 *
 * The driver supports 4 operations: open(), close(), ioctl(), read()
 * The device name is /dev/envctrl.
 * Below is sample usage:
 *
 *	fd = open("/dev/envtrl", O_RDONLY);
 *	if (ioctl(fd, ENVCTRL_READ_SHUTDOWN_TEMPERATURE, 0) < 0)
 *		printf("error\n");
 *	ret = read(fd, buf, 10);
 *	close(fd);
 *
 * Notice in the case of cpu voltage and temperature, the default is
 * cpu0.  If we need to know the info of cpu1, cpu2, cpu3, we need to
 * pass in cpu number in ioctl() last parameter.  For example, to
 * get the voltage of cpu2:
 *
 *	ioctlbuf[0] = 2;
 *	if (ioctl(fd, ENVCTRL_READ_CPU_VOLTAGE, ioctlbuf) < 0)
 *		printf("error\n");
 *	ret = read(fd, buf, 10);
 *
 * All the return values are in ascii.  So check read return value
 * and do appropriate conversions in your application.
