 * We used to warn all over the code: DO NOT USE prom_printf(),
 * and yet people do. Anton's banking code was outputting banks
 * with prom_printf for most of the 2.4 lifetime. Since an effective
 * stick is not available, we deployed a carrot: an early printk
 * through PROM by means of -p boot option. This ought to fix it.
 * USE printk; if you need, deploy -p.
