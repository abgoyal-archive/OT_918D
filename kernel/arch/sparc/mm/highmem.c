/*
 *  highmem.c: virtual kernel memory mappings for high memory
 *
 *  Provides kernel-static versions of atomic kmap functions originally
 *  found as inlines in include/asm-sparc/highmem.h.  These became
 *  needed as kmap_atomic() and kunmap_atomic() started getting
 *  called from within modules.
 *  -- Tomas Szepe <szepe@pinerecords.com>, September 2002
 *
 *  But kmap_atomic() and kunmap_atomic() cannot be inlined in
 *  modules because they are loaded with btfixup-ped functions.
 */

/*
 * The use of kmap_atomic/kunmap_atomic is discouraged - kmap/kunmap
 * gives a more generic (and caching) interface. But kmap_atomic can
 * be used in IRQ contexts, so in some (very limited) cases we need it.
 *
 * XXX This is an old text. Actually, it's good to use atomic kmaps,
 * provided you remember that they are atomic and not try to sleep
 * with a kmap taken, much like a spinlock. Non-atomic kmaps are
 * shared by CPUs, and so precious, and establishing them requires IPI.
 * Atomic kmaps are lightweight and we may have NCPUS more of them.
