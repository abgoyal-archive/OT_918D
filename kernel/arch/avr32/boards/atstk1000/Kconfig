	bool "Non-default STK1002/STK1003/STK1004 jumper settings"
	help
	  You will normally leave the jumpers on the CPU card at their
	  default settings.  If you need to use certain peripherals,
	  you will need to change some of those jumpers.

if BOARD_ATSTK100X_CUSTOM

config BOARD_ATSTK100X_SW1_CUSTOM
	bool "SW1: use SSC1 (not SPI0)"
	help
	  This also prevents using the external DAC as an audio interface,
	  and means you can't initialize the on-board QVGA display.

config BOARD_ATSTK100X_SW2_CUSTOM
	bool "SW2: use IRDA or TIMER0 (not UART-A, MMC/SD, and PS2-A)"
	help
	  If you change this you'll want an updated boot loader putting
	  the console on UART-C not UART-A.

config BOARD_ATSTK100X_SW3_CUSTOM
	bool "SW3: use TIMER1 (not SSC0 and GCLK)"
	help
	  This also prevents using the external DAC as an audio interface.

config BOARD_ATSTK100X_SW4_CUSTOM
	bool "SW4: use ISI/Camera (not GPIOs, SPI1, and PS2-B)"
	help
	  To use the camera interface you'll need a custom card (on the
	  PCI-format connector) connect a video sensor.

	  Select this if you have jumpered the J2 jumper block to the
	  LED0..LED7 amber leds, or to the RGB leds, using a ten-pin
	  IDC cable.  A default "heartbeat" trigger is provided, but
	  you can of course override this.

config BOARD_ATSTK1000_J2_LED8
	bool "LED0..LED7"
	help
	  Select this if J2 is jumpered to LED0..LED7 amber leds.
