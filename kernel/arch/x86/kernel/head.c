 * conventional memory (int 0x12) too. This also contains a
 * workaround for Dell systems that neglect to reserve EBDA.
 * The same workaround also avoids a problem with the AMD768MPX
 * chipset: reserve a page before VGA to prevent PCI prefetch
 * into it (errata #56). Usually the page is reserved anyways,
 * unless you have no PS/2 mouse plugged in.
