	  This is deprecated and this functionality is now merged into
	  acpi_cpufreq (X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ). Use that driver instead of
	  speedstep_centrino.
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for Enhanced SpeedStep enabled
	  mobile CPUs.  This means Intel Pentium M (Centrino) CPUs
	  or 64bit enabled Intel Xeons.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called speedstep-centrino.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  processors.  When enabled it will lower CPU temperature by skipping
	  clocks.

	tristate "VIA C7 Enhanced PowerSaver (DANGEROUS)"
	select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	depends on X86_32 && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for VIA C7 processors.  However, this driver
	  does not have any safeguards to prevent operating the CPU out of spec
	  and is thus considered dangerous.  Please use the regular ACPI cpufreq
	  driver, enabled by CONFIG_X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ.

	  If in doubt, say N.

comment "shared options"

config X86_SPEEDSTEP_LIB
	tristate

config X86_SPEEDSTEP_RELAXED_CAP_CHECK
	bool "Relaxed speedstep capability checks"
	depends on X86_32 && (X86_SPEEDSTEP_SMI || X86_SPEEDSTEP_ICH)
	help
	  Don't perform all checks for a speedstep capable system which would
	  normally be done. Some ancient or strange systems, though speedstep
	  capable, don't always indicate that they are speedstep capable. This
	  option lets the probing code bypass some of those checks if the
	  parameter "relaxed_check=1" is passed to the module.
