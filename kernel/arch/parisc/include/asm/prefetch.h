 * PA 2.0 defines data prefetch instructions on page 6-11 of the Kane book.
 * In addition, many implementations do hardware prefetching of both
 * instructions and data.
 *
 * PA7300LC (page 14-4 of the ERS) also implements prefetching by a load
 * to gr0 but not in a way that Linux can use.  If the load would cause an
 * interruption (eg due to prefetching 0), it is suppressed on PA2.0
 * processors, but not on 7300LC.
