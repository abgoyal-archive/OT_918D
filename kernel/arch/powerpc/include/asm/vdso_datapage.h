 * Note about this structure:
 *
 * This structure was historically called systemcfg and exposed to
 * userland via /proc/ppc64/systemcfg. Unfortunately, this became an
 * ABI issue as some proprietary software started relying on being able
 * to mmap() it, thus we have to keep the base layout at least for a
 * few kernel versions.
 *
 * However, since ppc32 doesn't suffer from this backward handicap,
 * a simpler version of the data structure is used there with only the
 * fields actually used by the vDSO.
