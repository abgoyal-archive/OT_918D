/*
 * The "classic" 32-bit implementation of the PowerPC MMU uses a hash
 * table containing PTEs, together with a set of 16 segment registers,
 * to define the virtual to physical address mapping.
 *
 * We use the hash table as an extended TLB, i.e. a cache of currently
 * active mappings.  We maintain a two-level page table tree, much
 * like that used by the i386, for the sake of the Linux memory
 * management code.  Low-level assembler code in hash_low_32.S
 * (procedure hash_page) is responsible for extracting ptes from the
 * tree and putting them into the hash table when necessary, and
 * updating the accessed and modified bits in the page table tree.
