/**
 * sys_spu_run - run code loaded into an SPU
 *
 * @unpc:    next program counter for the SPU
 * @ustatus: status of the SPU
 *
 * This system call transfers the control of execution of a
 * user space thread to an SPU. It will return when the
 * SPU has finished executing or when it hits an error
 * condition and it will be interrupted if a signal needs
 * to be delivered to a handler in user space.
 *
 * The next program counter is set to the passed value
 * before the SPU starts fetching code and the user space
 * pointer gets updated with the new value when returning
 * from kernel space.
 *
 * The status value returned from spu_run reflects the
 * value of the spu_status register after the SPU has stopped.
