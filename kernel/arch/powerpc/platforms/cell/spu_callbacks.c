 * This table defines the system calls that an SPU can call.
 * It is currently a subset of the 64 bit powerpc system calls,
 * with the exact semantics.
 *
 * The reasons for disabling some of the system calls are:
 * 1. They interact with the way SPU syscalls are handled
 *    and we can't let them execute ever:
 *	restart_syscall, exit, for, execve, ptrace, ...
 * 2. They are deprecated and replaced by other means:
 *	uselib, pciconfig_*, sysfs, ...
 * 3. They are somewhat interacting with the system in a way
 *    we don't want an SPU to:
 *	reboot, init_module, mount, kexec_load
 * 4. They are optional and we can't rely on them being
 *    linked into the kernel. Unfortunately, the cond_syscall
 *    helper does not work here as it does not add the necessary
 *    opd symbols:
 *	mbind, mq_open, ipc, ...
