config 8xx_COPYBACK
	bool "Copy-Back Data Cache (else Writethrough)"
	help
	  Saying Y here will cause the cache on an MPC8xx processor to be used
	  in Copy-Back mode.  If you say N here, it is used in Writethrough
	  mode.

	  If in doubt, say Y here.

config 8xx_CPU6
	bool "CPU6 Silicon Errata (860 Pre Rev. C)"
	help
	  MPC860 CPUs, prior to Rev C have some bugs in the silicon, which
	  require workarounds for Linux (and most other OSes to work).  If you
	  get a BUG() very early in boot, this might fix the problem.  For
	  more details read the document entitled "MPC860 Family Device Errata
	  Reference" on Freescale's website.  This option also incurs a
	  performance hit.

	  If in doubt, say N here.

config 8xx_CPU15
	bool "CPU15 Silicon Errata"
	default y
	help
	  This enables a workaround for erratum CPU15 on MPC8xx chips.
	  This bug can cause incorrect code execution under certain
	  circumstances.  This workaround adds some overhead (a TLB miss
	  every time execution crosses a page boundary), and you may wish
	  to disable it if you have worked around the bug in the compiler
	  (by not placing conditional branches or branches to LR or CTR
	  in the last word of a page, with a target of the last cache
	  line in the next page), or if you have used some other
	  workaround.

	  If in doubt, say Y here.
