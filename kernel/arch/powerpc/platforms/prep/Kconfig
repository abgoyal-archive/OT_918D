config PREP_RESIDUAL
	bool "Support for PReP Residual Data"
	depends on PPC_PREP
	help
	  Some PReP systems have residual data passed to the kernel by the
	  firmware.  This allows detection of memory size, devices present and
	  other useful pieces of information.  Sometimes this information is
	  not present or incorrect, in which case it could lead to the machine 
	  behaving incorrectly.  If this happens, either disable PREP_RESIDUAL
	  or pass the 'noresidual' option to the kernel.

	  If you are running a PReP system, say Y here, otherwise say N.

config PROC_PREPRESIDUAL
	bool "Support for reading of PReP Residual Data in /proc"
	depends on PREP_RESIDUAL && PROC_FS
	help
	  Enabling this option will create a /proc/residual file which allows
	  you to get at the residual data on PReP systems.  You will need a tool
	  (lsresidual) to parse it.  If you aren't on a PReP system, you don't
	  want this.
