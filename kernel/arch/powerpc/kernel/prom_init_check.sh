# This script checks prom_init.o to see what external symbols it
# is using, if it finds symbols not in the whitelist it returns
# an error. The point of this is to discourage people from
# intentionally or accidentally adding new code to prom_init.c
# which has side effects on other parts of the kernel.

# If you really need to reference something from prom_init.o add
# it to the list below:

WHITELIST="add_reloc_offset __bss_start __bss_stop copy_and_flush
_end enter_prom memcpy memset reloc_offset __secondary_hold
__secondary_hold_acknowledge __secondary_hold_spinloop __start
