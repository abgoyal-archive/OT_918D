 * Makes a tree bootable image for IBM Evaluation boards.
 * Basically, just take a zImage, skip the ELF header, and stuff
 * a 32 byte header on the front.
 *
 * We use htonl, which is a network macro, to make sure we're doing
 * The Right Thing on an LE machine.  It's non-obvious, but it should
 * work on anything BSD'ish.
