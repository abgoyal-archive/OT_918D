 * These functions are designed to make life easy for decompressing
 * kernel images, initrd images or any other gzip compressed image,
 * particularly if its useful to decompress part of the image (e.g. to
 * examine headers) before decompressing the remainder.
 *
 * To use:
 *     - declare a gunzip_state structure
 *     - use gunzip_start() to initialize the state, associating it
 *       with a stream of compressed data
 *     - use gunzip_partial(), gunzip_exactly() and gunzip_discard()
 *       in any combination to extract pieces of data from the stream
 *     - Finally use gunzip_finish() to extract the tail of the
 *       compressed stream and wind up zlib
