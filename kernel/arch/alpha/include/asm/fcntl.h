 * Before Linux 2.6.33 only O_DSYNC semantics were implemented, but using
 * the O_SYNC flag.  We continue to use the existing numerical value
 * for O_DSYNC semantics now, but using the correct symbolic name for it.
 * This new value is used to request true Posix O_SYNC semantics.  It is
 * defined in this strange way to make sure applications compiled against
 * new headers get at least O_DSYNC semantics on older kernels.
 *
 * This has the nice side-effect that we can simply test for O_DSYNC
 * wherever we do not care if O_DSYNC or O_SYNC is used.

 * Note: __O_SYNC must never be used directly.
