 * Fixup to mark boot BIOS video selected by BIOS before it changes

 * From information provided by "Jon Smirl" <jonsmirl@gmail.com>
 *
 * The standard boot ROM sequence for an x86 machine uses the BIOS
 * to select an initial video card for boot display. This boot video
 * card will have it's BIOS copied to C0000 in system RAM.
 * IORESOURCE_ROM_SHADOW is used to associate the boot video
 * card with this copy. On laptops this copy has to be used since
 * the main ROM may be compressed or combined with another image.
 * See pci_map_rom() for use of this flag. IORESOURCE_ROM_SHADOW
 * is marked here since the boot video device will be the only enabled
 * video device at this point.
