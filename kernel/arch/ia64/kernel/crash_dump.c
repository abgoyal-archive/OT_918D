 * @userbuf: if set, @buf is in user address space, use copy_to_user(),

 * Copy a page from "oldmem". For this page, there is no pte mapped
 * in the current kernel. We stitch up a pte, similar to kmap_atomic.

 * Calling copy_to_user() in atomic context is not desirable. Hence first
 * copying the data to a pre-allocated kernel page and then copying to user
 * space in non-atomic context.
