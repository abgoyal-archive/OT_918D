/*
 * IO error structure.
 *
 * This structure would expand to hold the information retrieved from
 * all IO related error registers.
 *
 * This structure is defined to hold all system specific
 * information related to a single error.
 *
 * This serves a couple of purpose.
 *      - Error handling often involves translating one form of address to other
 *        form. So, instead of having different data structures at each level,
 *        we have a single structure, and the appropriate fields get filled in
 *        at each layer.
 *      - This provides a way to dump all error related information in any layer
 *        of erorr handling (debugging aid).
 *
 * A second possibility is to allow each layer to define its own error
 * data structure, and fill in the proper fields. This has the advantage
 * of isolating the layers.
 * A big concern is the potential stack usage (and overflow), if each layer
 * defines these structures on stack (assuming we don't want to do kmalloc.
 *
 * Any layer wishing to pass extra information to a layer next to it in
 * error handling hierarchy, can do so as a separate parameter.
