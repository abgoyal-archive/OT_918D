 * Format a module id for printing.
 *
 * There are three possible formats:
 *
 *   MODULE_FORMAT_BRIEF	is the brief 6-character format, including
 *				the actual brick-type as recorded in the 
 *				moduleid_t, eg. 002c15 for a C-brick, or
 *				101#17 for a PX-brick.
 *
 *   MODULE_FORMAT_LONG		is the hwgraph format, eg. rack/002/bay/15
 *				of rack/101/bay/17 (note that the brick
 *				type does not appear in this format).
 *
 *   MODULE_FORMAT_LCD		is like MODULE_FORMAT_BRIEF, except that it
 *				ensures that the module id provided appears
 *				exactly as it would on the LCD display of
 *				the corresponding brick, eg. still 002c15
 *				for a C-brick, but 101p17 for a PX-brick.
 *
 * maule (9/13/04):  Removed top-level check for (fmt == MODULE_FORMAT_LCD)
 * making MODULE_FORMAT_LCD equivalent to MODULE_FORMAT_BRIEF.  It was
 * decided that all callers should assume the returned string should be what
 * is displayed on the brick L1 LCD.
