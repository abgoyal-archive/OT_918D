 * For performance reasons, we don't want to define CLOCK_TICK_TRATE as
 * local_cpu_data->itc_rate.  Fortunately, we don't have to, either: according to George
 * Anzinger, 1/CLOCK_TICK_RATE is taken as the resolution of the timer clock.  The time
 * calculation assumes that you will use enough of these so that your tick size <= 1/HZ.
 * If the calculation shows that your CLOCK_TICK_RATE can not supply exactly 1/HZ ticks,
 * the actual value is calculated and used to update the wall clock each jiffie.  Setting
 * the CLOCK_TICK_RATE to x*HZ insures that the calculation will find no errors.  Hence we
 * pick a multiple of HZ which gives us a (totally virtual) CLOCK_TICK_RATE of about
 * 100MHz.
