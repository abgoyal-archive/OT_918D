/*
 * Dreamcast System ASIC Hardware Events -
 *
 * The Dreamcast's System ASIC (a.k.a. Holly) is responsible for receiving
 * hardware events from system peripherals and triggering an SH7750 IRQ.
 * Hardware events can trigger IRQs 13, 11, or 9 depending on which bits are
 * set in the Event Mask Registers (EMRs).  When a hardware event is
 * triggered, its corresponding bit in the Event Status Registers (ESRs)
 * is set, and that bit should be rewritten to the ESR to acknowledge that
 * event.
 *
 * There are three 32-bit ESRs located at 0xa05f6900 - 0xa05f6908.  Event
 * types can be found in arch/sh/include/mach-dreamcast/mach/sysasic.h.
 * There are three groups of EMRs that parallel the ESRs.  Each EMR group
 * corresponds to an IRQ, so 0xa05f6910 - 0xa05f6918 triggers IRQ 13,
 * 0xa05f6920 - 0xa05f6928 triggers IRQ 11, and 0xa05f6930 - 0xa05f6938
 * triggers IRQ 9.
 *
 * In the kernel, these events are mapped to virtual IRQs so that drivers can
 * respond to them as they would a normal interrupt.  In order to keep this
 * mapping simple, the events are mapped as:
 *
 * 6900/6910 - Events  0-31, IRQ 13
 * 6904/6924 - Events 32-63, IRQ 11
 * 6908/6938 - Events 64-95, IRQ  9
 *
