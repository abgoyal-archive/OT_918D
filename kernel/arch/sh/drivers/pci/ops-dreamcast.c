 * someone implicitly messes around with the last devfn value.. otherwise we
 * only support a single device anyways, and if we didn't have a BBA, we
 * wouldn't make it terribly far through the PCI setup anyways.
 *
 * Also, we could very easily support both Type 0 and Type 1 configurations
 * here, but since it doesn't seem that there is any such implementation in
 * existence, we don't bother.
 *
 * I suppose if someone actually gets around to ripping the chip out of
 * the BBA and hanging some more devices off of it, then this might be
 * something to take into consideration. However, due to the cost of the BBA,
 * and the general lack of activity by DC hardware hackers, this doesn't seem
 * likely to happen anytime soon.
