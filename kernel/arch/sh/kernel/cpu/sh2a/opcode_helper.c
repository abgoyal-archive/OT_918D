 * Instructions on SH are generally fixed at 16-bits, however, SH-2A
 * introduces some 32-bit instructions. Since there are no real
 * constraints on their use (and they can be mixed and matched), we need
 * to check the instruction encoding to work out if it's a true 32-bit
 * instruction or not.
 *
 * Presently, 32-bit opcodes have only slight variations in what the
 * actual encoding looks like in the first-half of the instruction, which
 * makes it fairly straightforward to differentiate from the 16-bit ones.
