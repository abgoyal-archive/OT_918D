   currently out in swap space (see also mm/swap.c):
   bits 0-1 (PAGE_PRESENT) is  = 0
   bits 8..2 (SWP_TYPE) are = SHM_SWP_TYPE
   bits 31..9 are used like this:
   bits 15..9 (SHM_ID) the id of the shared memory segment
   bits 30..16 (SHM_IDX) the index of the page within the shared memory segment
                    (actually only bits 25..16 get used since SHMMAX is so low)
   bit 31 (SHM_READ_ONLY) flag whether the page belongs to a read-only attach
