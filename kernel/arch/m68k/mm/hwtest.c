/* Tests for presence or absence of hardware registers.
 * This code was originally in atari/config.c, but I noticed
 * that it was also in drivers/nubus/nubus.c and I wanted to
 * use it in hp300/config.c, so it seemed sensible to pull it
 * out into its own file.
 *
 * The test is for use when trying to read a hardware register
 * that isn't present would cause a bus error. We set up a
 * temporary handler so that this doesn't kill the kernel.
 *
 * There is a test-by-reading and a test-by-writing; I present
 * them here complete with the comments from the original atari
 * config.c...

/* This function tests for the presence of an address, specially a
 * hardware register address. It is called very early in the kernel
 * initialization process, when the VBR register isn't set up yet. On
 * an Atari, it still points to address 0, which is unmapped. So a bus
 * error would cause another bus error while fetching the exception
 * vector, and the CPU would do nothing at all. So we needed to set up
 * a temporary VBR and a vector table for the duration of the test.
