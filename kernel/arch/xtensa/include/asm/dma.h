 * The maximum virtual address to which DMA transfers

 *
 * NOTE: This is board (platform) specific, not processor-specific!
 *
 * NOTE: This assumes DMA transfers can only be performed on
 *	the section of physical memory contiguously mapped in virtual
 *	space for the kernel.  For the Xtensa architecture, this
 *	means the maximum possible size of this DMA area is
 *	the size of the statically mapped kernel segment
 *	(XCHAL_KSEG_{CACHED,BYPASS}_SIZE), ie. 128 MB.
 *
 * NOTE: When the entire KSEG area is DMA capable, we substract
 *	one from the max address so that the virt_to_phys() macro
 *	works correctly on the address (otherwise the address
 *	enters another area, and virt_to_phys() may not return
 *	the value desired).
