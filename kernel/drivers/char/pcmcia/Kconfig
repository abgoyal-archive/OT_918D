	help
	  Enable support for the SyncLink PC Card serial adapter, running
	  asynchronous and HDLC communications up to 512Kbps. The port is
	  selectable for RS-232, V.35, RS-449, RS-530, and X.21

	  This driver may be built as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called synclinkmp.  If you want to do that, say M
	  here.

	  PC/SC ifdhandler provided from the Omnikey homepage
	  (http://www.omnikey.com/), or a current development version of OpenCT
	  (http://www.opensc.org/).
