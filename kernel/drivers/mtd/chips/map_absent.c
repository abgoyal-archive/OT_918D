/*
 * Common code to handle absent "placeholder" devices
 * Copyright 2001 Resilience Corporation <ebrower@resilience.com>
 *
 * This map driver is used to allocate "placeholder" MTD
 * devices on systems that have socketed/removable media.
 * Use of this driver as a fallback preserves the expected
 * registration of MTD device nodes regardless of probe outcome.
 * A usage example is as follows:
 *
 *		my_dev[i] = do_map_probe("cfi", &my_map[i]);
 *		if(NULL == my_dev[i]) {
 *			my_dev[i] = do_map_probe("map_absent", &my_map[i]);
 *		}
 *
 * Any device 'probed' with this driver will return -ENODEV
 * upon open.
