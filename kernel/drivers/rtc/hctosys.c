/* IMPORTANT: the RTC only stores whole seconds. It is arbitrary
 * whether it stores the most close value or the value with partial
 * seconds truncated. However, it is important that we use it to store
 * the truncated value. This is because otherwise it is necessary,
 * in an rtc sync function, to read both xtime.tv_sec and
 * xtime.tv_nsec. On some processors (i.e. ARM), an atomic read
 * of >32bits is not possible. So storing the most close value would
 * slow down the sync API. So here we have the truncated value and
 * the best guess is to add 0.5s.
