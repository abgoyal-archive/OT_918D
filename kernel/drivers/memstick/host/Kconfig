comment "MemoryStick Host Controller Drivers"

config MEMSTICK_TIFM_MS
	tristate "TI Flash Media MemoryStick Interface support  (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && PCI
	select TIFM_CORE
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to be able to access MemoryStick cards with
	  the Texas Instruments(R) Flash Media card reader, found in many
	  laptops.
	  This option 'selects' (turns on, enables) 'TIFM_CORE', but you
	  probably also need appropriate card reader host adapter, such as
	  'Misc devices: TI Flash Media PCI74xx/PCI76xx host adapter support
	  (TIFM_7XX1)'.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called tifm_ms.

config MEMSTICK_JMICRON_38X
	tristate "JMicron JMB38X MemoryStick interface support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && PCI

	help
	  Say Y here if you want to be able to access MemoryStick cards with
	  the JMicron(R) JMB38X MemoryStick card reader.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called jmb38x_ms.
