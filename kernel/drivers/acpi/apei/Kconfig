config ACPI_APEI
	bool "ACPI Platform Error Interface (APEI)"
	depends on X86
	help
	  APEI allows to report errors (for example from the chipset)
	  to the operating system. This improves NMI handling
	  especially. In addition it supports error serialization and
	  error injection.

config ACPI_APEI_GHES
	tristate "APEI Generic Hardware Error Source"
	depends on ACPI_APEI && X86
	select ACPI_HED
	help
	  Generic Hardware Error Source provides a way to report
	  platform hardware errors (such as that from chipset). It
	  works in so called "Firmware First" mode, that is, hardware
	  errors are reported to firmware firstly, then reported to
	  Linux by firmware. This way, some non-standard hardware
	  error registers or non-standard hardware link can be checked
	  by firmware to produce more valuable hardware error
	  information for Linux.

config ACPI_APEI_EINJ
	tristate "APEI Error INJection (EINJ)"
	depends on ACPI_APEI && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  EINJ provides a hardware error injection mechanism, it is
	  mainly used for debugging and testing the other parts of
	  APEI and some other RAS features.
