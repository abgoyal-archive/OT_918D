/* 
 * 10 Apr 1998 (Good Friday) - Received EN144302 by email from Iomega.
 * Scarry thing is the level of support from one of their managers.
 * The onus is now on us (the developers) to shut up and start coding.
 *                                              11Apr98 [ 0.10 ]
 *
 * --- SNIP ---
 *
 * It manages to find the drive which is a good start. Writing data during
 * data phase is known to be broken (due to requirements of two byte writes).
 * Removing "Phase" debug messages.
 *
 * PS: Took four hours of coding after I bought a drive.
 *      ANZAC Day (Aus "War Veterans Holiday")  25Apr98 [ 0.14 ]
 *
 * Ten minutes later after a few fixes.... (LITERALLY!!!)
 * Have mounted disk, copied file, dismounted disk, remount disk, diff file
 *                    -----  It actually works!!! -----
 *                                              25Apr98 [ 0.15 ]
 *
 * Twenty minutes of mucking around, rearanged the IEEE negotiate mechanism.
 * Now have byte mode working (only EPP and ECP to go now... :=)
 *                                              26Apr98 [ 0.16 ]
 *
 * Thirty minutes of further coding results in EPP working on my machine.
 *                                              27Apr98 [ 0.17 ]
 *
 * Due to work commitments and inability to get a "true" ECP mode functioning
 * I have decided to code the parport support into imm.
 *                                              09Jun98 [ 0.18 ]
 *
 * Driver is now out of beta testing.
 * Support for parport has been added.
 * Now distributed with the ppa driver.
 *                                              12Jun98 [ 2.00 ]
 *
 * Err.. It appears that imm-2.00 was broken....
 *                                              18Jun98 [ 2.01 ]
 *
 * Patch applied to sync this against the Linux 2.1.x kernel code
 * Included qboot_zip.sh
 *                                              21Jun98 [ 2.02 ]
 *
 * Other clean ups include the follow changes:
 *    CONFIG_SCSI_PPA_HAVE_PEDANTIC => CONFIG_SCSI_IZIP_EPP16
 *    added CONFIG_SCSI_IZIP_SLOW_CTR option
 *                                                      [2.03]
 *  Fix kernel panic on scsi timeout.		20Aug00 [2.04]
 *
 *  Avoid io_request_lock problems.
