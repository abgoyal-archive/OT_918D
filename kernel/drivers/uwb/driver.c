 *  UWB radio controller:
 *
 *    1. alloc a uwb_rc, zero it
 *    2. call uwb_rc_init() on it to set it up + ops (won't do any
 *       kind of allocation)
 *    3. register (now it is owned by the UWB stack--deregister before
 *       freeing/destroying).
 *    4. It lives on it's own now (UWB stack handles)--when it
 *       disconnects, call unregister()
 *    5. free it.
 *
 *    Make sure you have a reference to the uwb_rc before calling
 *    any of the UWB API functions.
 *
 * TODO:
 *
 * 1. Locking and life cycle management is crappy still. All entry
 *    points to the UWB HCD API assume you have a reference on the
 *    uwb_rc structure and that it won't go away. They mutex lock it
 *    before doing anything.
