 *
 * The USB isight cameras in recent Apples are roughly compatible with the USB
 * video class specification, and can be driven by uvcvideo. However, they
 * need firmware to be loaded beforehand. After firmware loading, the device
 * detaches from the USB bus and reattaches with a new device ID. It can then
 * be claimed by the uvc driver.
 *
 * The firmware is non-free and must be extracted by the user. Tools to do this
 * are available at http://bersace03.free.fr/ift/
 *
 * The isight firmware loading was reverse engineered by Johannes Berg
 * <johannes@sipsolutions.de>, and this driver is based on code by Ronald
 * Bultje <rbultje@ronald.bitfreak.net>
