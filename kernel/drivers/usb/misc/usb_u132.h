*
* The driver was written by Tony Olech(tony.olech@elandigitalsystems.com)
* based on various USB client drivers in the 2.6.15 linux kernel
* with constant reference to the 3rd Edition of Linux Device Drivers
* published by O'Reilly
*
* The U132 adapter is a USB to CardBus adapter specifically designed
* for PC cards that contain an OHCI host controller. Typical PC cards
* are the Orange Mobile 3G Option GlobeTrotter Fusion card.
*
* The U132 adapter will *NOT *work with PC cards that do not contain
* an OHCI controller. A simple way to test whether a PC card has an
* OHCI controller as an interface is to insert the PC card directly
* into a laptop(or desktop) with a CardBus slot and if "lspci" shows
* a new USB controller and "lsusb -v" shows a new OHCI Host Controller
* then there is a good chance that the U132 adapter will support the
* PC card.(you also need the specific client driver for the PC card)
*
* Please inform the Author and Maintainer about any PC cards that
* contain OHCI Host Controller and work when directly connected to
* an embedded CardBus slot but do not work when they are connected
* via an ELAN U132 adapter.
*
* The driver consists of two modules, the "ftdi-u132" module is
* a USB client driver that interfaces to the FTDI chip within
* the U132 adapter manufactured by Elan Digital Systems, and the
* "u132-hcd" module is a USB host controller driver that talks
* to the OHCI controller within CardBus card that are inserted
* in the U132 adapter.
*
* The "ftdi-u132" module should be loaded automatically by the
* hot plug system when the U132 adapter is plugged in. The module
* initialises the adapter which mostly consists of synchronising
* the FTDI chip, before continuously polling the adapter to detect
* PC card insertions. As soon as a PC card containing a recognised
* OHCI controller is seen the "ftdi-u132" module explicitly requests
* the kernel to load the "u132-hcd" module.
*
* The "ftdi-u132" module provides the interface to the inserted
* PC card and the "u132-hcd" module uses the API to send and receive
* data. The API features call-backs, so that part of the "u132-hcd"
* module code will run in the context of one of the kernel threads
* of the "ftdi-u132" module.
