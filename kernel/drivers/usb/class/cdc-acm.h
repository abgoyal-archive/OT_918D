 * The only reason to have several buffers is to accomodate assumptions

 * and proceed to issue several 1-character writes, assuming they will fit.
 * The very first write takes a complete URB. Fortunately, this only happens
 * when processing onlcr, so we only need 2 buffers. These values must be
