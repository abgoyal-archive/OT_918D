 * This is a clocksource driver for the Geode SCx200's 1 or 27 MHz
 * high-resolution timer.  The Geode SC-1100 (at least) has a buggy
 * time stamp counter (TSC), which loses time unless 'idle=poll' is
 * given as a boot-arg. In its absence, the Generic Timekeeping code
 * will detect and de-rate the bad TSC, allowing this timer to take
 * over timekeeping duties.
 *
