comment "MMC/SD/SDIO Card Drivers"

config MMC_BLOCK
	tristate "MMC block device driver"
	depends on BLOCK
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the MMC block device driver support.
	  This provides a block device driver, which you can use to
	  mount the filesystem. Almost everyone wishing MMC support
	  should say Y or M here.

config MMC_BLOCK_BOUNCE
	bool "Use bounce buffer for simple hosts"
	depends on MMC_BLOCK
	default y
	help
	  SD/MMC is a high latency protocol where it is crucial to
	  send large requests in order to get high performance. Many
	  controllers, however, are restricted to continuous memory
	  (i.e. they can't do scatter-gather), something the kernel
	  rarely can provide.

	  Say Y here to help these restricted hosts by bouncing
	  requests back and forth from a large buffer. You will get
	  a big performance gain at the cost of up to 64 KiB of
	  physical memory.

	  If unsure, say Y here.

config MMC_BLOCK_DEFERRED_RESUME
	bool "Deferr MMC layer resume until I/O is requested"
	depends on MMC_BLOCK
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to enable deferred MMC resume until I/O
	  is requested. This will reduce overall resume latency and
	  save power when theres an SD card inserted but not being used.

config SDIO_UART
	tristate "SDIO UART/GPS class support"
	help
	  SDIO function driver for SDIO cards that implements the UART
	  class, as well as the GPS class which appears like a UART.

config MMC_TEST
	tristate "MMC host test driver"
	default n
	help
	  Development driver that performs a series of reads and writes
	  to a memory card in order to expose certain well known bugs
	  in host controllers. The tests are executed by writing to the
	  "test" file in sysfs under each card. Note that whatever is
	  on your card will be overwritten by these tests.

	  This driver is only of interest to those developing or
	  testing a host driver. Most people should say N here.
