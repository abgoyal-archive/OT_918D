	fit2.c is a low-level protocol driver for the older version
        of the Fidelity International Technology parallel port adapter.  
	This adapter is used in their TransDisk 2000 and older TransDisk
	3000 portable hard-drives.  As far as I can tell, this device
	supports 4-bit mode _only_.  

	Newer models of the FIT products use an enhanced protocol.
	The "fit3" protocol module should support current drives.
