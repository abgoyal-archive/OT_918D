	This is the "pseudo-interrupt" logic for parallel port drivers.

        This module is #included into each driver.  It makes one
        function available:

		ps_set_intr( void (*continuation)(void),
			     int  (*ready)(void),
			     int timeout,
			     int nice )

	Which will arrange for ready() to be evaluated frequently and
	when either it returns true, or timeout jiffies have passed,
	continuation() will be invoked.

	If nice is 1, the test will done approximately once a
	jiffy.  If nice is 0, the test will also be done whenever
	the scheduler runs (by adding it to a task queue).  If
	nice is greater than 1, the test will be done once every
	(nice-1) jiffies.
