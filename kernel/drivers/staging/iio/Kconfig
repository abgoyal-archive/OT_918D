menuconfig IIO
	tristate "Industrial I/O support"
	depends on !S390
	---help---
	  The industrial I/O subsystem provides a unified framework for
	  drivers for many different types of embedded sensors using a
	  number of different physical interfaces (i2c, spi, etc). See
	  Documentation/industrialio for more information.
if IIO

config IIO_RING_BUFFER
	bool "Enable ring buffer support within IIO"
	help
	  Provide core support for various ring buffer based data
	  acquisition methods.

if IIO_RING_BUFFER

config IIO_SW_RING
	tristate "Industrial I/O lock free software ring"
	help
	  Example software ring buffer implementation.  The design aim
	  of this particular realization was to minimize write locking
	  with the intention that some devices would be able to write
	  in interrupt context.

endif # IIO_RINGBUFFER

config IIO_TRIGGER
	boolean "Enable triggered sampling support"
	help
	  Provides IIO core support for triggers.  Currently these
	  are used to initialize capture of samples to push into
	  ring buffers.  The triggers are effectively a 'capture
	  data now' interrupt.
