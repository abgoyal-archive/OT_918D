 * We use the same version numbering for all Hyper-V modules.

 * Definition of versioning is as follows;
 *
 *	Major Number	Changes for these scenarios;
 *			1.	When a new version of Windows Hyper-V
 *				is released.
 *			2.	A Major change has occurred in the
 *				Linux IC's.
 *			(For example the merge for the first time
 *			into the kernel) Every time the Major Number
 *			changes, the Revision number is reset to 0.
 *	Minor Number	Changes when new functionality is added
