config INTC_USERIMASK
	bool "Userspace interrupt masking support"
	depends on ARCH_SHMOBILE || (SUPERH && CPU_SH4A)
	help
	  This enables support for hardware-assisted userspace hardirq
	  masking.

	  SH-4A and newer interrupt blocks all support a special shadowed
	  page with all non-masking registers obscured when mapped in to
	  userspace. This is primarily for use by userspace device
	  drivers that are using special priority levels.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config INTC_BALANCING
	bool "Hardware IRQ balancing support"
	depends on SMP && SUPERH && CPU_SUBTYPE_SH7786
	help
	  This enables support for IRQ auto-distribution mode on SH-X3
	  SMP parts. All of the balancing and CPU wakeup decisions are
	  taken care of automatically by hardware for distributed
	  vectors.

	  If in doubt, say N.
