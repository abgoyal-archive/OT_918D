config USB_SI470X
	tristate "Silicon Labs Si470x FM Radio Receiver support with USB"
	depends on USB && RADIO_SI470X
	---help---
	  This is a driver for USB devices with the Silicon Labs SI470x
	  chip. Currently these devices are known to work:
	  - 10c4:818a: Silicon Labs USB FM Radio Reference Design
	  - 06e1:a155: ADS/Tech FM Radio Receiver (formerly Instant FM Music)
	  - 1b80:d700: KWorld USB FM Radio SnapMusic Mobile 700 (FM700)
	  - 10c5:819a: Sanei Electric FM USB Radio (aka DealExtreme.com PCear)

	  Sound is provided by the ALSA USB Audio/MIDI driver. Therefore
	  if you don't want to use the device solely for RDS receiving,
	  it is recommended to also select SND_USB_AUDIO.

	  Please have a look at the documentation, especially on how
	  to redirect the audio stream from the radio to your sound device:
	  Documentation/video4linux/si470x.txt

	  Say Y here if you want to connect this type of radio to your
	  computer's USB port.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called radio-usb-si470x.

config I2C_SI470X
	tristate "Silicon Labs Si470x FM Radio Receiver support with I2C"
	depends on I2C && RADIO_SI470X && !USB_SI470X
	---help---
	  This is a driver for I2C devices with the Silicon Labs SI470x
	  chip.

	  Say Y here if you want to connect this type of radio to your
	  computer's I2C port.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called radio-i2c-si470x.
