	---help---
	  The Motorola Scalable Controller Area Network (MSCAN) definition
	  is based on the MSCAN12 definition which is the specific
	  implementation of the Motorola Scalable CAN concept targeted for
	  the Motorola MC68HC12 Microcontroller Family.

if CAN_MSCAN

config CAN_MPC5XXX
	tristate "Freescale MPC5xxx onboard CAN controller"
	depends on (PPC_MPC52xx || PPC_MPC512x)
	---help---
	  If you say yes here you get support for Freescale's MPC5xxx
	  onboard CAN controller. Currently, the MPC5200, MPC5200B and
	  MPC5121 (Rev. 2 and later) are supported.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called mscan-mpc5xxx.ko.
