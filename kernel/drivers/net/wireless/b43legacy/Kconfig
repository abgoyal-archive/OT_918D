	---help---
	  b43legacy is a driver for 802.11b devices from Broadcom (BCM4301 and
	  BCM4303) and early model 802.11g chips (BCM4306 Ver. 2) used in the
	  Linksys WPC54G V1 PCMCIA devices.

	  Newer 802.11g and 802.11a devices need b43.

	  It is safe to include both b43 and b43legacy as the underlying glue
	  layer will automatically load the correct version for your device.

	  This driver uses V3 firmware, which must be installed separately using
	  b43-fwcutter.

	  This driver can be built as a module (recommended) that will be
	  called "b43legacy". If unsure, say M.

config B43LEGACY_DMA_AND_PIO_MODE
	bool "DMA + PIO"
	select B43LEGACY_DMA
	select B43LEGACY_PIO
	---help---
	  Include both, Direct Memory Access (DMA) and Programmed I/O (PIO)
	  data transfer modes. The mode actually used is selectable through
	  the module parameter "pio". With pio=0 as a module parameter, the
	  default DMA is used, otherwise PIO is used.

	  If unsure, choose this option.

config B43LEGACY_DMA_MODE
	bool "DMA (Direct Memory Access) only"
	select B43LEGACY_DMA
	---help---
	  Only include Direct Memory Access (DMA).
	  This reduces the size of the driver module, by omitting the PIO code.

config B43LEGACY_PIO_MODE
	bool "PIO (Programmed I/O) only"
	select B43LEGACY_PIO
	---help---
	  Only include Programmed I/O (PIO).
	  This reduces the size of the driver module, by omitting the DMA code.
	  Please note that PIO transfers are slow (compared to DMA).

	  Also note that not all devices of the b43legacy series support PIO.

	  You should use PIO only if DMA does not work for you.
