	  This is the driver for the Ethernet IPs are built around a
	  Synopsys IP Core and fully tested on the STMicroelectronics
	  platforms.

config STMMAC_DA
	bool "STMMAC DMA arbitration scheme"
	default n
	help
	  Selecting this option, rx has priority over Tx (only for Giga
	  Ethernet device).
	  By default, the DMA arbitration scheme is based on Round-robin
	  (rx:tx priority is 1:1).

	bool "STMMAC: dual mac support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	default n
        depends on EXPERIMENTAL && STMMAC_ETH && !STMMAC_TIMER
	help
	  Some ST SoCs (for example the stx7141 and stx7200c2) have two
	  Ethernet Controllers. This option turns on the second Ethernet
	  device on this kind of platforms.

config STMMAC_TIMER
	bool "STMMAC Timer optimisation"
	default n
	help
	  Use an external timer for mitigating the number of network
	  interrupts. Currently, for SH architectures, it is possible
	  to use the TMU channel 2 and the SH-RTC device.
