	select CRC32
	help
	  This driver supports the IBM EMAC family of Ethernet controllers
	  typically found on 4xx embedded PowerPC chips, but also on the
	  Axon southbridge for Cell.

	help
	  Additional receive skb headroom. Note, that driver
	  will always reserve at least 2 bytes to make IP header
	  aligned, so usually there is no need to add any additional
	  headroom.

	  If unsure, set to 0.
