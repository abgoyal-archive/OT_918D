	help

	  Select the maximum debug verbosity level to be compiled into
	  the WiMAX i2400m driver code.

	  By default, this is disabled at runtime and can be
	  selectively enabled at runtime for different parts of the
	  code using the sysfs debug-levels file.

	  If set at zero, this will compile out all the debug code.

	  It is recommended that it is left at 8.
