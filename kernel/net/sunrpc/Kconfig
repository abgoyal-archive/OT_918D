	default SUNRPC && INFINIBAND
	help
	  This option allows the NFS client and server to support
	  an RDMA-enabled transport.

	  To compile RPC client RDMA transport support as a module,
	  choose M here: the module will be called xprtrdma.

	  If unsure, say N.

	select CRYPTO_MD5
	select CRYPTO_DES
	select CRYPTO_CBC
	help
	  Choose Y here to enable Secure RPC using the Kerberos version 5
	  GSS-API mechanism (RFC 1964).

	  Secure RPC calls with Kerberos require an auxiliary user-space
	  daemon which may be found in the Linux nfs-utils package
	  available from http://linux-nfs.org/.  In addition, user-space
	  Kerberos support should be installed.

	  If unsure, say N.

	select CRYPTO_CBC
	help
	  Choose Y here to enable Secure RPC using the SPKM3 public key
	  GSS-API mechanism (RFC 2025).

	  Secure RPC calls with SPKM3 require an auxiliary userspace
	  daemon which may be found in the Linux nfs-utils package
	  available from http://linux-nfs.org/.

	  If unsure, say N.
