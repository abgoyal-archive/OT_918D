 *		Demultiplex 802.2 encoded protocols. We match the entry by the
 *		SSAP/DSAP pair and then deliver to the registered datalink that
 *		matches. The control byte is ignored and handling of such items
 *		is up to the routine passed the frame.
 *
 *		Unlike the 802.3 datalink we have a list of 802.2 entries as
 *		there are multiple protocols to demux. The list is currently
 *		short (3 or 4 entries at most). The current demux assumes this.
