/*
 * INET		An implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite for the LINUX
 *		operating system.  INET is implemented using the  BSD Socket
 *		interface as the means of communication with the user level.
 *
 *		INET protocol dispatch tables.
 *
 * Authors:	Ross Biro
 *		Fred N. van Kempen, <waltje@uWalt.NL.Mugnet.ORG>
 *
 * Fixes:
 *		Alan Cox	: Ahah! udp icmp errors don't work because
 *				  udp_err is never called!
 *		Alan Cox	: Added new fields for init and ready for
 *				  proper fragmentation (_NO_ 4K limits!)
 *		Richard Colella	: Hang on hash collision
 *		Vince Laviano	: Modified inet_del_protocol() to correctly
 *				  maintain copy bit.
