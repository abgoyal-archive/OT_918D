# Acorn Econet/AUN protocols

config ECONET
	tristate "Acorn Econet/AUN protocols (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && INET
	---help---
	  Econet is a fairly old and slow networking protocol mainly used by
	  Acorn computers to access file and print servers. It uses native
	  Econet network cards. AUN is an implementation of the higher level
	  parts of Econet that runs over ordinary Ethernet connections, on
	  top of the UDP packet protocol, which in turn runs on top of the
	  Internet protocol IP.

	  If you say Y here, you can choose with the next two options whether
	  to send Econet/AUN traffic over a UDP Ethernet connection or over
	  a native Econet network card.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called econet.

config ECONET_AUNUDP
	bool "AUN over UDP"
	depends on ECONET
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to send Econet/AUN traffic over a UDP
	  connection (UDP is a packet based protocol that runs on top of the
	  Internet protocol IP) using an ordinary Ethernet network card.

config ECONET_NATIVE
	bool "Native Econet"
	depends on ECONET
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a native Econet network card installed in
	  your computer.
