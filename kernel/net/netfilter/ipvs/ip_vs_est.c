/*
  This code is to estimate rate in a shorter interval (such as 8
  seconds) for virtual services and real servers. For measure rate in a
  long interval, it is easy to implement a user level daemon which
  periodically reads those statistical counters and measure rate.

  Currently, the measurement is activated by slow timer handler. Hope
  this measurement will not introduce too much load.

  We measure rate during the last 8 seconds every 2 seconds:

    avgrate = avgrate*(1-W) + rate*W

    where W = 2^(-2)

  NOTES.

  * The stored value for average bps is scaled by 2^5, so that maximal
    rate is ~2.15Gbits/s, average pps and cps are scaled by 2^10.

  * A lot code is taken from net/sched/estimator.c
