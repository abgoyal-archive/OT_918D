	  The Trusted Computing Group(TCG) runtime Integrity
	  Measurement Architecture(IMA) maintains a list of hash
	  values of executables and other sensitive system files,
	  as they are read or executed. If an attacker manages
	  to change the contents of an important system file
	  being measured, we can tell.

	  If your system has a TPM chip, then IMA also maintains
	  an aggregate integrity value over this list inside the
	  TPM hardware, so that the TPM can prove to a third party
	  whether or not critical system files have been modified.
	  Read <http://www.usenix.org/events/sec04/tech/sailer.html>
	  to learn more about IMA.
	  If unsure, say N.

config IMA_MEASURE_PCR_IDX
	int
	depends on IMA
	range 8 14
	default 10
	help
	  IMA_MEASURE_PCR_IDX determines the TPM PCR register index
	  that IMA uses to maintain the integrity aggregate of the
	  measurement list.  If unsure, use the default 10.

config IMA_AUDIT
	bool
	depends on IMA
	default y
	help
	  This option adds a kernel parameter 'ima_audit', which
	  allows informational auditing messages to be enabled
	  at boot.  If this option is selected, informational integrity
	  auditing messages can be enabled with 'ima_audit=1' on
	  the kernel command line.

config IMA_LSM_RULES
	bool
	depends on IMA && AUDIT && (SECURITY_SELINUX || SECURITY_SMACK)
	default y
	help
	  Disabling this option will disregard LSM based policy rules.
