/*
 * hugepage-mmap:
 *
 * Example of using huge page memory in a user application using the mmap
 * system call.  Before running this application, make sure that the
 * administrator has mounted the hugetlbfs filesystem (on some directory
 * like /mnt) using the command mount -t hugetlbfs nodev /mnt. In this
 * example, the app is requesting memory of size 256MB that is backed by
 * huge pages.
 *
 * For the ia64 architecture, the Linux kernel reserves Region number 4 for
 * huge pages.  That means that if one requires a fixed address, a huge page
 * aligned address starting with 0x800000... will be required.  If a fixed
 * address is not required, the kernel will select an address in the proper
 * range.
 * Other architectures, such as ppc64, i386 or x86_64 are not so constrained.
