 * Example of using hugepage memory in a user application using the mmap

 * sure the administrator has allocated enough default sized huge pages
 * to cover the 256 MB allocation.
 *
 * For ia64 architecture, Linux kernel reserves Region number 4 for hugepages.
 * That means the addresses starting with 0x800000... will need to be
 * specified.  Specifying a fixed address is not required on ppc64, i386
 * or x86_64.
