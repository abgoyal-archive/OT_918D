config INOTIFY
	bool "Inotify file change notification support"
	default n
	---help---
	  Say Y here to enable legacy in kernel inotify support.  Inotify is a
	  file change notification system.  It is a replacement for dnotify.
	  This option only provides the legacy inotify in kernel API.  There
	  are no in tree kernel users of this interface since it is deprecated.
	  You only need this if you are loading an out of tree kernel module
	  that uses inotify.

	  For more information, see <file:Documentation/filesystems/inotify.txt>

	  If unsure, say N.

config INOTIFY_USER
	bool "Inotify support for userspace"
	select ANON_INODES
	select FSNOTIFY
	default y
	---help---
	  Say Y here to enable inotify support for userspace, including the
	  associated system calls.  Inotify allows monitoring of both files and
	  directories via a single open fd.  Events are read from the file
	  descriptor, which is also select()- and poll()-able.
	  Inotify fixes numerous shortcomings in dnotify and introduces several
	  new features including multiple file events, one-shot support, and
	  unmount notification.

	  For more information, see <file:Documentation/filesystems/inotify.txt>

	  If unsure, say Y.
