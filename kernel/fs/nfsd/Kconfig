config NFSD
	tristate "NFS server support"
	depends on INET
	depends on FILE_LOCKING
	select LOCKD
	select SUNRPC
	select EXPORTFS
	select NFS_ACL_SUPPORT if NFSD_V2_ACL
	help
	  Choose Y here if you want to allow other computers to access
	  files residing on this system using Sun's Network File System
	  protocol.  To compile the NFS server support as a module,
	  choose M here: the module will be called nfsd.

	  You may choose to use a user-space NFS server instead, in which
	  case you can choose N here.

	  To export local file systems using NFS, you also need to install
	  user space programs which can be found in the Linux nfs-utils
	  package, available from http://linux-nfs.org/.  More detail about
	  the Linux NFS server implementation is available via the
	  exports(5) man page.

	  Below you can choose which versions of the NFS protocol are
	  available to clients mounting the NFS server on this system.
	  Support for NFS version 2 (RFC 1094) is always available when
	  CONFIG_NFSD is selected.

	  If unsure, say N.

config NFSD_V2_ACL
	bool
	depends on NFSD

config NFSD_V3
	bool "NFS server support for NFS version 3"
	depends on NFSD
	help
	  This option enables support in your system's NFS server for
	  version 3 of the NFS protocol (RFC 1813).

	  If unsure, say Y.

config NFSD_V3_ACL
	bool "NFS server support for the NFSv3 ACL protocol extension"
	depends on NFSD_V3
	select NFSD_V2_ACL
	help
	  Solaris NFS servers support an auxiliary NFSv3 ACL protocol that
	  never became an official part of the NFS version 3 protocol.
	  This protocol extension allows applications on NFS clients to
	  manipulate POSIX Access Control Lists on files residing on NFS
	  servers.  NFS servers enforce POSIX ACLs on local files whether
	  this protocol is available or not.

	  This option enables support in your system's NFS server for the
	  NFSv3 ACL protocol extension allowing NFS clients to manipulate
	  POSIX ACLs on files exported by your system's NFS server.  NFS
	  clients which support the Solaris NFSv3 ACL protocol can then
	  access and modify ACLs on your NFS server.

	  To store ACLs on your NFS server, you also need to enable ACL-
	  related CONFIG options for your local file systems of choice.

	  If unsure, say N.

config NFSD_V4
	bool "NFS server support for NFS version 4 (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on NFSD && PROC_FS && EXPERIMENTAL
	select NFSD_V3
	select FS_POSIX_ACL
	select RPCSEC_GSS_KRB5
	help
	  This option enables support in your system's NFS server for
	  version 4 of the NFS protocol (RFC 3530).

	  To export files using NFSv4, you need to install additional user
	  space programs which can be found in the Linux nfs-utils package,
	  available from http://linux-nfs.org/.

	  If unsure, say N.
