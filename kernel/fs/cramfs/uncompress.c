 * cramfs interfaces to the uncompression library. There's really just
 * three entrypoints:
 *
 *  - cramfs_uncompress_init() - called to initialize the thing.
 *  - cramfs_uncompress_exit() - tell me when you're done
 *  - cramfs_uncompress_block() - uncompress a block.
 *
 * NOTE NOTE NOTE! The uncompression is entirely single-threaded. We
 * only have one stream, and we'll initialize it only once even if it
 * then is used by multiple filesystems.
