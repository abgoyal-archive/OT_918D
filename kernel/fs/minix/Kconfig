config MINIX_FS
	tristate "Minix file system support"
	depends on BLOCK
	help
	  Minix is a simple operating system used in many classes about OS's.
	  The minix file system (method to organize files on a hard disk
	  partition or a floppy disk) was the original file system for Linux,
	  but has been superseded by the second extended file system ext2fs.
	  You don't want to use the minix file system on your hard disk
	  because of certain built-in restrictions, but it is sometimes found
	  on older Linux floppy disks.  This option will enlarge your kernel
	  by about 28 KB. If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called minix.  Note that the file system of your root
	  partition (the one containing the directory /) cannot be compiled as
	  a module.
