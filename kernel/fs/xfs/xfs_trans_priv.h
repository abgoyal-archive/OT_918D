 * AIL traversal cursor.
 *
 * Rather than using a generation number for detecting changes in the ail, use
 * a cursor that is protected by the ail lock. The aild cursor exists in the
 * struct xfs_ail, but other traversals can declare it on the stack and link it
 * to the ail list.
 *
 * When an object is deleted from or moved int the AIL, the cursor list is
 * searched to see if the object is a designated cursor item. If it is, it is
 * deleted from the cursor so that the next time the cursor is used traversal
 * will return to the start.
 *
 * This means a traversal colliding with a removal will cause a restart of the
 * list scan, rather than any insertion or deletion anywhere in the list. The
 * low bit of the item pointer is set if the cursor has been invalidated so
 * that we can tell the difference between invalidation and reaching the end
 * of the list to trigger traversal restarts.
