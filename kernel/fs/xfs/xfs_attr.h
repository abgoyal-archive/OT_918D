 * Large attribute lists are structured around Btrees where all the data
 * elements are in the leaf nodes.  Attribute names are hashed into an int,
 * then that int is used as the index into the Btree.  Since the hashval
 * of an attribute name may not be unique, we may have duplicate keys.
 * The internal links in the Btree are logical block offsets into the file.
 *
 * Small attribute lists use a different format and are packed as tightly
 * as possible so as to fit into the literal area of the inode.
