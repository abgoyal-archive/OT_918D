config EXT2_FS
	tristate "Second extended fs support"
	help
	  Ext2 is a standard Linux file system for hard disks.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ext2.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config EXT2_FS_XATTR
	bool "Ext2 extended attributes"
	depends on EXT2_FS
	help
	  Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated with inodes by
	  the kernel or by users (see the attr(5) manual page, or visit
	  <http://acl.bestbits.at/> for details).

	  If unsure, say N.

config EXT2_FS_POSIX_ACL
	bool "Ext2 POSIX Access Control Lists"
	depends on EXT2_FS_XATTR
	select FS_POSIX_ACL
	help
	  Posix Access Control Lists (ACLs) support permissions for users and
	  groups beyond the owner/group/world scheme.

	  To learn more about Access Control Lists, visit the Posix ACLs for
	  Linux website <http://acl.bestbits.at/>.

	  If you don't know what Access Control Lists are, say N

config EXT2_FS_SECURITY
	bool "Ext2 Security Labels"
	depends on EXT2_FS_XATTR
	help
	  Security labels support alternative access control models
	  implemented by security modules like SELinux.  This option
	  enables an extended attribute handler for file security
	  labels in the ext2 filesystem.

	  If you are not using a security module that requires using
	  extended attributes for file security labels, say N.

config EXT2_FS_XIP
	bool "Ext2 execute in place support"
	depends on EXT2_FS && MMU
	help
	  Execute in place can be used on memory-backed block devices. If you
	  enable this option, you can select to mount block devices which are
	  capable of this feature without using the page cache.

	  If you do not use a block device that is capable of using this,
	  or if unsure, say N.
