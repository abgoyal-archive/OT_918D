 *
 * parity = ocfs2_hamming_encode(0, buf1, 512 * 8, 0);

 * Fix a buffer with a bit error.  The 'fix' is the original parity

 *
 * Like ocfs2_hamming_encode(), this can handle hunks.  nr is the bit
 * offset of the current hunk.  If bit to be fixed is not part of the
 * current hunk, this does nothing.
 *
 * If you only have one buffer, use ocfs2_hamming_fix_block().
