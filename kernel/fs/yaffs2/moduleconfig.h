Older-style on-NAND data format has a "pageStatus" byte to record
chunk/page state.  This byte is zeroed when the page is discarded.
Choose this option if you have existing on-NAND data in this format
that you need to continue to support.  New data written also uses the
older-style format.
Note: Use of this option generally requires that MTD's oob layout be
adjusted to use the older-style format.  See notes on tags formats and
MTD versions in yaffs_mtdif1.c.
