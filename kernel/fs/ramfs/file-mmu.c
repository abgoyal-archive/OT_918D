 * NOTE! This filesystem is probably most useful

 * how virtual filesystems can be written.
 *
 * It doesn't get much simpler than this. Consider
 * that this file implements the full semantics of
 * a POSIX-compliant read-write filesystem.
 *
 * Note in particular how the filesystem does not
 * need to implement any data structures of its own
 * to keep track of the virtual data: using the VFS
 * caches is sufficient.
