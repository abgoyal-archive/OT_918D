config CONFIGFS_FS
	tristate "Userspace-driven configuration filesystem"
	depends on SYSFS
	help
	  configfs is a ram-based filesystem that provides the converse
	  of sysfs's functionality. Where sysfs is a filesystem-based
	  view of kernel objects, configfs is a filesystem-based manager
	  of kernel objects, or config_items.

	  Both sysfs and configfs can and should exist together on the
	  same system. One is not a replacement for the other.
