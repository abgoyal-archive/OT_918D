/*
 * This file implements code to handle compressed fragments (tail-end packed
 * datablocks).
 *
 * Regular files contain a fragment index which is mapped to a fragment
 * location on disk and compressed size using a fragment lookup table.
 * Like everything in Squashfs this fragment lookup table is itself stored
 * compressed into metadata blocks.  A second index table is used to locate
 * these.  This second index table for speed of access (and because it
 * is small) is read at mount time and cached in memory.
