	  UBIFS is a file system for flash devices which works on top of UBI.

config UBIFS_FS_XATTR
	bool "Extended attributes support"
	depends on UBIFS_FS
	help
	  This option enables support of extended attributes.

config UBIFS_FS_ADVANCED_COMPR
	bool "Advanced compression options"
	depends on UBIFS_FS
	help
	  This option allows to explicitly choose which compressions, if any,
	  are enabled in UBIFS. Removing compressors means inability to read
	  existing file systems.

	  If unsure, say 'N'.

config UBIFS_FS_LZO
	bool "LZO compression support" if UBIFS_FS_ADVANCED_COMPR
	depends on UBIFS_FS
	default y
	help
	   LZO compressor is generally faster than zlib but compresses worse.
	   Say 'Y' if unsure.

config UBIFS_FS_ZLIB
	bool "ZLIB compression support" if UBIFS_FS_ADVANCED_COMPR
	depends on UBIFS_FS
	default y
	help
	  Zlib compresses better than LZO but it is slower. Say 'Y' if unsure.

# Debugging-related stuff
config UBIFS_FS_DEBUG
	bool "Enable debugging"
	depends on UBIFS_FS
	select DEBUG_FS
	select KALLSYMS_ALL
	help
	  This option enables UBIFS debugging.

config UBIFS_FS_DEBUG_MSG_LVL
	int "Default message level (0 = no extra messages, 3 = lots)"
	depends on UBIFS_FS_DEBUG
	default "0"
	help
	  This controls the amount of debugging messages produced by UBIFS.
	  If reporting bugs, please try to have available a full dump of the
	  messages at level 1 while the misbehaviour was occurring. Level 2
	  may become necessary if level 1 messages were not enough to find the
	  bug. Generally Level 3 should be avoided.

config UBIFS_FS_DEBUG_CHKS
	bool "Enable extra checks"
	depends on UBIFS_FS_DEBUG
	help
	  If extra checks are enabled UBIFS will check the consistency of its
	  internal data structures during operation. However, UBIFS performance
	  is dramatically slower when this option is selected especially if the
	  file system is large.
