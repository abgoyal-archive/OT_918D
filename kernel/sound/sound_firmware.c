 *	mod_firmware_load - load sound driver firmware
 *	@fn: filename

 *
 *	Load the firmware for a sound module (up to 128K) into a buffer.
 *	The buffer is returned in *fp. It is allocated with vmalloc so is
 *	virtually linear and not DMAable. The caller should free it with
 *	vfree when finished.
 *
 *	The length of the buffer is returned on a successful load, the
 *	value zero on a failure.
 *
 *	Caution: This API is not recommended. Firmware should be loaded via
 *	request_firmware.
