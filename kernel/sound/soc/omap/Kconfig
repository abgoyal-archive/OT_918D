	  Say Y  if you want to add support  for SoC audio device  connected to
	  a handset and a speakerphone found on Amstrad E3 (Delta) videophone.

	  Note that in order to get those devices fully supported,  you have to
	  build  the kernel  with  standard  serial port  driver  included  and
	  configured for at least 4 ports.  Then, from userspace, you must load
	  a line discipline #19 on the modem (ttyS3) serial line.  The simplest
	  way to achieve this is to install util-linux-ng  and use the included
	  ldattach  utility.  This  can be  started  automatically  from  udev,
	  a simple rule like this one should do the trick (it does for me):
	  	ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="controlC0", \
				RUN+="/usr/sbin/ldattach 19 /dev/ttyS3"
