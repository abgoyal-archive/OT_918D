menuconfig SND_SPI
	bool "SPI sound devices"
	depends on SPI
	default y
	help
	  Support for sound devices connected via the SPI bus.

if SND_SPI

config SND_AT73C213

	depends on ATMEL_SSC
	select SND_PCM
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use the Atmel AT73C213 external DAC. This
	  DAC can be found on Atmel development boards.

	  This driver requires the Atmel SSC driver for sound sink, a
	  peripheral found on most AT91 and AVR32 microprocessors.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called snd-at73c213.

config SND_AT73C213_TARGET_BITRATE
	int "Target bitrate for AT73C213"
	depends on SND_AT73C213
	default "48000"
	range 8000 50000
	help
	  Sets the target bitrate for the bitrate calculator in the driver.
	  Limited by hardware to be between 8000 Hz and 50000 Hz.

	  Set to 48000 Hz by default.
