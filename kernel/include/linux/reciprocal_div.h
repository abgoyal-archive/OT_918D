/*
 * This file describes reciprocical division.
 *
 * This optimizes the (A/B) problem, when A and B are two u32
 * and B is a known value (but not known at compile time)
 *
 * The math principle used is :
 *   Let RECIPROCAL_VALUE(B) be (((1LL << 32) + (B - 1))/ B)
 *   Then A / B = (u32)(((u64)(A) * (R)) >> 32)
 *
 * This replaces a divide by a multiply (and a shift), and
 * is generally less expensive in CPU cycles.
 */

/*
 * Computes the reciprocal value (R) for the value B of the divisor.
 * Should not be called before each reciprocal_divide(),
 * or else the performance is slower than a normal divide.
