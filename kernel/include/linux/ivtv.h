/* ivtv knows several distinct output modes: MPEG streaming,
   YUV streaming, YUV updates through user DMA and the passthrough
   mode.

   In order to clearly tell the driver that we are in user DMA
   YUV mode you need to call IVTV_IOC_DMA_FRAME with y_source == NULL
   first (althrough if you don't then the first time
   DMA_FRAME is called the mode switch is done automatically).

   When you close the file handle the user DMA mode is exited again.

   While in one mode, you cannot use another mode (EBUSY is returned).

   All this means that if you want to change the YUV interlacing
   for the user DMA YUV mode you first need to do call IVTV_IOC_DMA_FRAME
   with y_source == NULL before you can set the correct format using
   VIDIOC_S_FMT.

   Eventually all this should be replaced with a proper V4L2 API,
   but for now we have to do it this way. */
