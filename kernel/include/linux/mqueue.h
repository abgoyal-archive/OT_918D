 * SIGEV_THREAD implementation:

 * to mq_notify, then
 * - sigev_signo must be the file descriptor of an AF_NETLINK socket. It's not
 *   necessary that the socket is bound.
 * - sigev_value.sival_ptr must point to a cookie that is NOTIFY_COOKIE_LEN
 *   bytes long.
 * If the notification is triggered, then the cookie is sent to the netlink
 * socket. The last byte of the cookie is replaced with the NOTIFY_?? codes:
 * NOTIFY_WOKENUP if the notification got triggered, NOTIFY_REMOVED if it was
 * removed, either due to a close() on the message queue fd or due to a
 * mq_notify() that removed the notification.
