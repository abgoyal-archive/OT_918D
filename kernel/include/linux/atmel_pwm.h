/**
 * struct pwm_channel - driver handle to a PWM channel
 * @regs: base of this channel's registers
 * @index: number of this channel (0..31)
 * @mck: base clock rate, which can be prescaled and maybe subdivided
 *
 * Drivers initialize a pwm_channel structure using pwm_channel_alloc().
 * Then they configure its clock rate (derived from MCK), alignment,
 * polarity, and duty cycle by writing directly to the channel registers,
 * before enabling the channel by calling pwm_channel_enable().
 *
 * After emitting a PWM signal for the desired length of time, drivers
 * may then pwm_channel_disable() or pwm_channel_free().  Both of these
 * disable the channel, but when it's freed the IRQ is deconfigured and
 * the channel must later be re-allocated and reconfigured.
 *
 * Note that if the period or duty cycle need to be changed while the
 * PWM channel is operating, drivers must use the PWM_CUPD double buffer
 * mechanism, either polling until they change or getting implicitly
 * notified through a once-per-period interrupt handler.
