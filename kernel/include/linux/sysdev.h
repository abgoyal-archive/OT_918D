/**
 * System devices follow a slightly different driver model. 
 * They don't need to do dynammic driver binding, can't be probed, 
 * and don't reside on any type of peripheral bus. 
 * So, we represent and treat them a little differently.
 * 
 * We still have a notion of a driver for a system device, because we still
 * want to perform basic operations on these devices. 
 *
 * We also support auxillary drivers binding to devices of a certain class.
 * 
 * This allows configurable drivers to register themselves for devices of
 * a certain type. And, it allows class definitions to reside in generic
 * code while arch-specific code can register specific drivers.
 *
 * Auxillary drivers registered with a NULL cls are registered as drivers
 * for all system devices, and get notification calls for each device.
