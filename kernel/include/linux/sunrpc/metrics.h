 *
 *  Copyright (C) 2005	Chuck Lever <cel@netapp.com>
 *
 *  RPC client per-operation statistics provide latency and retry
 *  information about each type of RPC procedure in a given RPC program.
 *  These statistics are not for detailed problem diagnosis, but simply
 *  to indicate whether the problem is local or remote.
 *
 *  These counters are not meant to be human-readable, but are meant to be
 *  integrated into system monitoring tools such as "sar" and "iostat".  As
 *  such, the counters are sampled by the tools over time, and are never
 *  zeroed after a file system is mounted.  Moving averages can be computed
 *  by the tools by taking the difference between two instantaneous samples
 *  and dividing that by the time between the samples.
 *
 *  The counters are maintained in a single array per RPC client, indexed
 *  by procedure number.  There is no need to maintain separate counter
 *  arrays per-CPU because these counters are always modified behind locks.
