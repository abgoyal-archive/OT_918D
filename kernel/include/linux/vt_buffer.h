 *	include/linux/vt_buffer.h -- Access to VT screen buffer
 *
 *	(c) 1998 Martin Mares <mj@ucw.cz>
 *
 *	This is a set of macros and functions which are used in the
 *	console driver and related code to access the screen buffer.
 *	In most cases the console works with simple in-memory buffer,
 *	but when handling hardware text mode consoles, we store
 *	the foreground console directly in video memory.
