 * As seen through Linux I2C, differences between the most common types of I2C
 * memory include:
 * - How much memory is available (usually specified in bit)?
 * - What write page size does it support?
 * - Special flags (16 bit addresses, read_only, world readable...)?
 *
 * If you set up a custom eeprom type, please double-check the parameters.
 * Especially page_size needs extra care, as you risk data loss if your value
 * is bigger than what the chip actually supports!
