/**
   nsc_gpio.c

   National Semiconductor GPIO common access methods.

   struct nsc_gpio_ops abstracts the low-level access
   operations for the GPIO units on 2 NSC chip families; the GEODE
   integrated CPU, and the PC-8736[03456] integrated PC-peripheral
   chips.

   The GPIO units on these chips have the same pin architecture, but
   the access methods differ.  Thus, scx200_gpio and pc8736x_gpio
   implement their own versions of these routines; and use the common
   file-operations routines implemented in nsc_gpio module.

   NB: this work was tested on the Geode SC-1100 and PC-87366 chips.
   NSC sold the GEODE line to AMD, and the PC-8736x line to Winbond.
