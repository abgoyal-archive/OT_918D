 * @pwm_channel: which PWM channel in the PWM module to use.
 * @pwm_frequency: PWM frequency to generate, the driver will try to be as
 *	close as the prescaler allows.
 * @pwm_compare_max: value to use in the PWM channel compare register.
 * @pwm_duty_max: maximum duty cycle value, must be less than or equal to

 * @pwm_duty_min: minimum duty cycle value, must be less than pwm_duty_max.
 * @pwm_active_low: set to one if the low part of the PWM signal increases the
 *	brightness of the backlight.
 * @gpio_on: GPIO line to control the backlight on/off, set to -1 if not used.
 * @on_active_low: set to one if the on/off signal is on when GPIO is low.
 *
 * This struct must be added to the platform device in the board code. It is
 * used by the atmel-pwm-bl driver to setup the GPIO to control on/off and the
