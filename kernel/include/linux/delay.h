 * Using udelay() for intervals greater than a few milliseconds can

 * mdelay() provides a wrapper to prevent this.  For delays greater

 * specific values can be defined in asm-???/delay.h as an override.
 * The 2nd mdelay() definition ensures GCC will optimize away the 
 * while loop for the common cases where n <= MAX_UDELAY_MS  --  Paul G.
