 * Breakdown of the ioctl's available.  An 'optional' next to the command
 * indicates that supporting this command is optional, while 'required'

 *
 * MMTIMER_GETOFFSET - optional
 *   Should return the offset (relative to the start of the page where the
 *   registers are mapped) for the counter in question.
 *
 * MMTIMER_GETRES - required
 *   The resolution of the clock in femto (10^-15) seconds
 *
 * MMTIMER_GETFREQ - required
 *   Frequency of the clock in Hz
 *
 * MMTIMER_GETBITS - required
 *   Number of bits in the clock's counter
 *
 * MMTIMER_MMAPAVAIL - required
 *   Returns nonzero if the registers can be mmap'd into userspace, 0 otherwise
 *
 * MMTIMER_GETCOUNTER - required
 *   Gets the current value in the counter
