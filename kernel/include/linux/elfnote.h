/*
 * Helper macros to generate ELF Note structures, which are put into a
 * PT_NOTE segment of the final vmlinux image.  These are useful for
 * including name-value pairs of metadata into the kernel binary (or
 * modules?) for use by external programs.
 *
 * Each note has three parts: a name, a type and a desc.  The name is
 * intended to distinguish the note's originator, so it would be a
 * company, project, subsystem, etc; it must be in a suitable form for
 * use in a section name.  The type is an integer which is used to tag
 * the data, and is considered to be within the "name" namespace (so
 * "FooCo"'s type 42 is distinct from "BarProj"'s type 42).  The
 * "desc" field is the actual data.  There are no constraints on the
 * desc field's contents, though typically they're fairly small.
 *
 * All notes from a given NAME are put into a section named
 * .note.NAME.  When the kernel image is finally linked, all the notes
 * are packed into a single .notes section, which is mapped into the
 * PT_NOTE segment.  Because notes for a given name are grouped into
 * the same section, they'll all be adjacent the output file.
 *
 * This file defines macros for both C and assembler use.  Their
 * syntax is slightly different, but they're semantically similar.
 *
 * See the ELF specification for more detail about ELF notes.

/*
 * Generate a structure with the same shape as Elf{32,64}_Nhdr (which

 * desc data with appropriate padding.  The 'desctype' argument is the
 * assembler pseudo op defining the type of the data e.g. .asciz while
 * 'descdata' is the data itself e.g.  "hello, world".
 *
 * e.g. ELFNOTE(XYZCo, 42, .asciz, "forty-two")
