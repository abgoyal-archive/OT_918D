/* Grzegorz Borowiak <grzes@gnu.univ.gda.pl> 2003
 * 
 * Write-once-read-many hash table, used for checking if a given
 * MAC address belongs to a set or not and possibly for checking
 * if it is related with a given IPv4 address.
 *
 * The hash value of an address is its last byte.
 * 
 * In real-world ethernet addresses, values of the last byte are
 * evenly distributed and there is no need to consider other bytes.
 * It would only slow the routines down.
 *
 * For MAC address comparison speedup reasons, we introduce a trick.
 * MAC address is mapped onto an array of two 32-bit integers.
 * This pair of integers is compared with MAC addresses in the
 * hash table, which are stored also in form of pairs of integers
 * (in `cmp' array). This is quick as it requires only two elementary
 * number comparisons in worst case. Further, we take advantage of
 * fact that entropy of 3 last bytes of address is larger than entropy
 * of 3 first bytes. So first we compare 4 last bytes of addresses and
 * if they are the same we compare 2 first.
 *
 * Yes, it is a memory overhead, but in 2003 AD, who cares?
