 * generic msqid64_ds structure.
 *
 * Note extra padding because this structure is passed back and forth
 * between kernel and user space.
 *
 * msqid64_ds was originally meant to be architecture specific, but
 * everyone just ended up making identical copies without specific
 * optimizations, so we may just as well all use the same one.
 *
 * 64 bit architectures typically define a 64 bit __kernel_time_t,
 * so they do not need the first three padding words.
 * On big-endian systems, the padding is in the wrong place.
 *
 * Pad space is left for:
 * - 64-bit time_t to solve y2038 problem
 * - 2 miscellaneous 32-bit values
