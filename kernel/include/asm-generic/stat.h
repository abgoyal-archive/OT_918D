 * Everybody gets this wrong and has to stick with it for all
 * eternity. Hopefully, this version gets used by new architectures
 * so they don't fall into the same traps.
 *
 * stat64 is copied from powerpc64, with explicit padding added.
 * stat is the same structure layout on 64-bit, without the 'long long'
 * types.
 *
 * By convention, 64 bit architectures use the stat interface, while
 * 32 bit architectures use the stat64 interface. Note that we don't
 * provide an __old_kernel_stat here, which new architecture should
 * not have to start with.
