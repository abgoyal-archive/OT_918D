/*
 * Trace files that want to automate creationg of all tracepoints defined
 * in their file should include this file. The following are macros that the
 * trace file may define:
 *
 * TRACE_SYSTEM defines the system the tracepoint is for
 *
 * TRACE_INCLUDE_FILE if the file name is something other than TRACE_SYSTEM.h
 *     This macro may be defined to tell define_trace.h what file to include.
 *     Note, leave off the ".h".
 *
 * TRACE_INCLUDE_PATH if the path is something other than core kernel include/trace
 *     then this macro can define the path to use. Note, the path is relative to
 *     define_trace.h, not the file including it. Full path names for out of tree
 *     modules must be used.
