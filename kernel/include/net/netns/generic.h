/*
 * Generic net pointers are to be used by modules to put some private
 * stuff on the struct net without explicit struct net modification
 *
 * The rules are simple:
 * 1. set pernet_operations->id.  After register_pernet_device you
 *    will have the id of your private pointer.
 * 2. set pernet_operations->size to have the code allocate and free
 *    a private structure pointed to from struct net.
 * 3. do not change this pointer while the net is alive;
 * 4. do not try to have any private reference on the net_generic object.
 *
 * After accomplishing all of the above, the private pointer can be
 * accessed with the net_generic() call.
