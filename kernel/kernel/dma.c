 *
 * 1994/12/26: Changes by Alex Nash to fix a minor bug in /proc/dma.
 *   In the previous version the reported device could end up being wrong,

 *   [It also happened to remove the sizeof(char *) == sizeof(int)
 *   assumption introduced because of those /proc/dma patches. -- Hennus]

/* A note on resource allocation:
 *
 * All drivers needing DMA channels, should allocate and release them
 * through the public routines `request_dma()' and `free_dma()'.
 *
 * In order to avoid problems, all processes should allocate resources in
 * the same sequence and release them in the reverse order.
 *
 * So, when allocating DMAs and IRQs, first allocate the IRQ, then the DMA.
 * When releasing them, first release the DMA, then release the IRQ.
 * If you don't, you may cause allocation requests to fail unnecessarily.
 * This doesn't really matter now, but it will once we get real semaphores
 * in the kernel.
