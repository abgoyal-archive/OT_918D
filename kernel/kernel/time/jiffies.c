/* Since jiffies uses a simple NSEC_PER_JIFFY multiplier
 * conversion, the .shift value could be zero. However
 * this would make NTP adjustments impossible as they are
 * in units of 1/2^.shift. Thus we use JIFFIES_SHIFT to
 * shift both the nominator and denominator the same
 * amount, and give ntp adjustments in units of 1/2^8
 *
 * The value 8 is somewhat carefully chosen, as anything
 * larger can result in overflows. NSEC_PER_JIFFY grows as
 * HZ shrinks, so values greater than 8 overflow 32bits when
 * HZ=100.
