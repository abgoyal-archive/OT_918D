// The behavior of many of the functions in the <ctype.h> header is dependent
// on the current locale. But almost all uses of these functions are for
// locale-independent, ASCII-specific purposes. In WebKit code we use our own
// ASCII-specific functions instead. This header makes sure we get a compile-time
// error if we use one of the <ctype.h> functions by accident.
