 * engines may choose not to use to use them.
 *
 * <p>The preContext and postContext strings include some part of the
 * context surrounding the error.  If the source text is "let for=7"
 * and "for" is the error (e.g., because it is a reserved word), then
 * some examples of what a parser might produce are the following:
 *
 * <pre>
 * preContext   postContext

 * ""           "for"         Error text only

 *
 * <p>Examples of engines which use UParseError (or may use it in the

 * RegexPattern.
