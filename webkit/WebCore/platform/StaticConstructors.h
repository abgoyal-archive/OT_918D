#ifndef StaticConstructors_h
#define StaticConstructors_h

// For WebCore we need to avoid having static constructors. We achieve this
// with two separate methods for GCC and MSVC. Both methods prevent the static
// initializers from being registered and called on program startup. On GCC, we
// declare the global objects with a different type that can be POD default
// initialized by the linker/loader. On MSVC we use a special compiler feature
// to have the CRT ignore our static initializers. The constructors will never
// be called and the objects will be left uninitialized.
//
// With both of these approaches, we must define and explicitly call an init
// routine that uses placement new to create the objects and overwrite the
// uninitialized placeholders.
//
// This is not completely portable, but is what we have for now without
// changing how a lot of code accesses these global objects.

#ifdef SKIP_STATIC_CONSTRUCTORS_ON_MSVC
// - Assume that all includes of this header want ALL of their static
//   initializers ignored. This is currently the case. This means that if
//   a .cc includes this header (or it somehow gets included), all static
//   initializers after the include will not be executed.
// - We do this with a pragma, so that all of the static initializer pointers
//   go into our own section, and the CRT won't call them. Eventually it would
//   be nice if the section was discarded, because we don't want the pointers.
//   See: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7977wcck(VS.80).aspx
