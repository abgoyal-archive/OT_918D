/**
 * \file 
 * \brief C UConverter functions to aid the writers of callbacks
 *
 * <h2> Callback API for UConverter </h2>
 * 
 * These functions are provided here for the convenience of the callback
 * writer. If you are just looking for callback functions to use, please
 * see ucnv_err.h.  DO NOT call these functions directly when you are 
 * working with converters, unless your code has been called as a callback
 * via ucnv_setFromUCallback or ucnv_setToUCallback !!
 * 
 * A note about error codes and overflow.  Unlike other ICU functions,
 * these functions do not expect the error status to be U_ZERO_ERROR.
 * Callbacks must be much more careful about their error codes.
 * The error codes used here are in/out parameters, which should be passed
 * back in the callback's error parameter.
 * 
 * For example, if you call ucnv_cbfromUWriteBytes to write data out 
 * to the output codepage, it may return U_BUFFER_OVERFLOW_ERROR if 
 * the data did not fit in the target. But this isn't a failing error, 
 * in fact, ucnv_cbfromUWriteBytes may be called AGAIN with the error
 * status still U_BUFFER_OVERFLOW_ERROR to attempt to write further bytes,
 * which will also go into the internal overflow buffers.
 * 
 * Concerning offsets, the 'offset' parameters here are relative to the start
 * of SOURCE.  For example, Suppose the string "ABCD" was being converted 
 * from Unicode into a codepage which doesn't have a mapping for 'B'.
 * 'A' will be written out correctly, but
 * The FromU Callback will be called on an unassigned character for 'B'.
 * At this point, this is the state of the world:
 *    Target:    A [..]     [points after A]
 *    Source:  A B [C] D    [points to C - B has been consumed]
 *             0 1  2  3 
 *    codePoint = "B"       [the unassigned codepoint] 
 * 
 * Now, suppose a callback wants to write the substitution character '?' to
 * the target. It calls ucnv_cbFromUWriteBytes() to write the ?. 
 * It should pass ZERO as the offset, because the offset as far as the 
 * callback is concerned is relative to the SOURCE pointer [which points 
 * before 'C'.]  If the callback goes into the args and consumes 'C' also,
 * it would call FromUWriteBytes with an offset of 1 (and advance the source
 * pointer).
 *
