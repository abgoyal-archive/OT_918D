// This implements a counter tree that is used for finding parents in counters() lookup,

// by "counter-reset" style rules or implicitly by referring to a counter that is not in scope.
// Such nodes are tagged as "reset" nodes, although they are not all due to "counter-reset".

// Not that render tree children are often counter tree siblings due to counter scoping rules.
